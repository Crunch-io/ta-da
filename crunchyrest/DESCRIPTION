Title: Hacking Shiny To Build a Crunch(y) REST API
Description: The goal of crunchyrest is to allow you to set up a REST API for 
    Crunch services by hacking into a Shiny app. Of course, this isn't a good 
    way to set up a JSON API server: you shouldn't use Shiny for that. But, if 
    you can't easily set up "proper" web services that access R's capabilities, 
    but you can deploy Crunchy apps, this will work :)
