      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re adding an interface enhancement that brings the existing functionality of toggling between subtotals, categories, or both in tables and graphs, right at your fingertips. Although not new, our user testing revealed that many users were unaware of this feature, and we believe this more visible placement will make it more obvious and easier to use.&#xA;You can now choose from these options via dedicated icons in the main Display Controller panel, making your data viewing and analysis more straightforward and intuitive.</description>

      <description>Tables in the application now let you set a column as the basis of comparison, shading the table to show which other columns are higher or lower than the reference column, and to what level of statistical significance. The test is a two-tailed t test comparing each column proportion in turn to the proportion in the reference column. In a multitable, the test is conducted between categories within each column variable, and not across column variables.</description>
