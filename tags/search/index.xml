      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the next generation of search in Crunch. Our new variable search gives you more from your data by enabling quick and accurate retrieval of relevant insights with a simplified search UI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Search your data using natural language rather than simple keywords â€“ type the way you would normally talk and the search will find relevant variables throughout your data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Open any dataset to see the AI-search field above the list of variables in the left sidebar. Simply enter your search criteria and press Enter to find a sorted list of relevant search results. Click or drag &amp;amp; drop a variable in the search results to analyze the data in Crunch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Search has been a part of Crunch from the beginning. In a system designed to house and share large volumes of data, the ability to quickly find the data that&amp;rsquo;s important right now is critical. We&amp;rsquo;re continually working to improve how data is indexed to make searching faster and more accurate, and we just added a couple new ways for you to refine your searches to get to what you are looking for faster and more easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
