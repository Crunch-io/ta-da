      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When editing a dashboard, you already have access to lots of great customizations via the existing tabs of the “Edit Tile” interface – Properties, Categories and Colors. For most visualization types, you’ll now find a fourth tab – Options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;img-fluid center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://player-crunch-io.s3.amazonaws.com/help-crunch-io/screenshots/options_tab.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-options-tab&#34;&gt;The new Options tab&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The contents of this tab will include most of the following options, though the actual set will vary depending on the visualization type you’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quickly grab a copy of the current visualization or tile</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/quick-copy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to announce a great new feature in response to user feedback which will save you time when you just want a quick copy of the table, graph or dashboard tile on-screen, ready to insert into an email to a colleague or a presentation slide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The existing export options for fully editable Excel tables and PowerPoint slides remain available, but now you have new options within dashboards, Variable Summaries mode and Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode. Each enables you to quickly generate a PNG image of the current tile, table or visualization and then choose whether to download it to your computer or copy it to your clipboard ready to paste elsewhere. Here’s how each one appears…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bring your graphs to life with new mouse hover behavior</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/graph-hover-behavior/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/graph-hover-behavior/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find that Crunch graphs now respond to hovering your mouse over the lines, bars and segments. The hovered part will retain full opacity while the other lines, bars or segments will fade, making it easier to clearly see the data of interest. This applies to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Single variable bar graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grouped bar graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stacked bar graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Donut graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Line graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also hover over the legend items to have Crunch highlight that ‘series’ or category. It can be particularly helpful for crowded line graphs, making the path of any individual line much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bringing the Enhanced Bar Plot capabilities to Grouped Bar Plots</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-grouped-bar-plots/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 10:01:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-grouped-bar-plots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-matters&#34;&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your survey data is crucial to making informed decisions. While Crunch has always been at the forefront of providing survey analytics tools, we believe that data visualization can play a more prominent role in the research process. That’s why we&amp;rsquo;ve revamped our grouped bar plots to bring you an even more intuitive and insightful experience, bringing them in line with the enhancements already brought to univariate bar plots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Design with Confidence: Achieve design consistency in dashboards with this new feature</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/min-max-width-dashboard/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 19:18:56 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/min-max-width-dashboard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce an update that brings added control to your dashboard designs. Our new feature allows you to specify minimum and maximum widths for your dashboards, enabling a more consistent and visually appealing experience across various screen sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This update is a direct response to your feedback. Many of you have expressed the need for more control over how your dashboards appear to end-users, and we listened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing KPI Comparisons: Gain Deeper Insights from Your Dashboards</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/kpi-comparisons/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2023 11:06:08 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/kpi-comparisons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce a new feature that will help you gain more value from your KPI dashboard tiles - KPI comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With KPI comparisons, you can now display the difference between your current KPI value and a different value of interest from the same table. This could be vs. the previous wave, the last year, a key competitor - whichever comparison provides the most meaningful context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, your brand awareness may be 73%, which seems okay on its own. But when you see it&amp;rsquo;s increased 5% vs. last wave, you realize it&amp;rsquo;s great news.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Easily Toggle Between Subtotals, Categories, or Both</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotals-toggle/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 16:45:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotals-toggle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;re adding an interface enhancement that brings the existing functionality of toggling between subtotals, categories, or both in tables and graphs, right at your fingertips. Although not new, our user testing revealed that many users were unaware of this feature, and we believe this more visible placement will make it more obvious and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can now choose from these options via dedicated icons in the main Display Controller panel, making your data viewing and analysis more straightforward and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Enhanced Bar Plots in Crunch – Best Practice in Survey Data Visualization</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-bar-plots/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2023 15:29:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-bar-plots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to announce a significant update that will enhance the way you visualize and interpret your survey data. Our Upgraded Bar Plots have been redesigned with a cleaner layout, more easily readable text, and now feature the display of confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-matters&#34;&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your survey data is crucial to making informed decisions. While Crunch has always been at the forefront of providing survey analytics tools, we believe that data visualization can play a more prominent role in the research process. That’s why we&amp;rsquo;ve revamped our univariate bar plots to bring you an even more intuitive and insightful experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Subtotals and calculated differences can now be shown on graphs</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/graphing-subtotals-and-differences/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 21:37:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/graphing-subtotals-and-differences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Subtotals have been a feature of Crunch for years, and calculated differences were added to the feature set in May 2021. They&amp;rsquo;ve been popular features in tables and thanks to this latest release, they&amp;rsquo;re now available in graphs too. Both subtotals and differences can now be displayed in graphs in Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode, as well as on dashboards and in PPTX exports, giving you the flexibility to display, save and report these summary statistics just like any other variable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Create a grouping (array) of numeric variables for easy comparison</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/numeric-arrays/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 14:05:22 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/numeric-arrays/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Numeric Arrays enable you to work efficiently with groups of numeric variables that are related. For example, you might have asked your respondents for the number of times they have engaged with each of a list of activities, or asked for how many times they&amp;rsquo;ve purchased each of a list of products, or asked for a numeric rating for how much they agree with a list of statements. In each case, the data collected consist of a set of numeric values. With Numeric Arrays, you now have a convenient way of combining these numeric variables into a single &amp;lsquo;parent&amp;rsquo; variable. This is similar to the existing Categorical Arrays type which combine categorical variables into a single &amp;lsquo;parent&amp;rsquo; variable for easy analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Add subtotals to multiple response variables</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotals-mr/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:30:25 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotals-mr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dataset editors have been able to add subtotals (a.k.a. “nets”) to categorical and categorical array variables for a long time, but this hasn’t been the case for multiple response variables. There are many applications for subtotals on multiple response variables — a common one is a group of products or sub-brands within a brand, or a grouping of statements into themes. Previously, users had to define new variables with often complex logic to describe each combination, and then hide the input variable. Now, Crunch provides a way to specify combinations of items directly on multiple response variables. And even better, these subtotal categories will appear on graphs in Crunch, including on time-series graphs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crunch&#39;s new visualizations for time-series analyses and trackers are now extended to Date/Time variables</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/date-time-variables/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:39:46 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/date-time-variables/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in April this year, we announced that a great new visualization was available for time series analyses that used the new &amp;ldquo;Categorical Date&amp;rdquo; variable type. Existing time plots that used the older Date/Time variable type were unaffected and continued to use the previous line graph component. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve worked to extend the new line graph functionality to those original Date/Time variables so that everyone can benefit from their better design and functionality, and we can now announce that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; time plots will be using the new visualization. Below you will find a summary of what you can expect from your new time plots in Crunch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sort your graph categories automatically</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/sort-by-value/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 11:27:47 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/sort-by-value/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve been able to sort categories in &lt;em&gt;tables&lt;/em&gt; in Crunch for a long time, but previously when you switched to a graph, that sorting was lost and the graph would show the categories in their original variable order. Now, the sorting you apply in a table will be carried through into a graph when you switch visualization type, as well as being made part of the analysis definition when you save a graph to the deck. That means that the sorted order will show in dashboards, including when you apply a filter, and in PowerPoint exports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Show calculated differences between categories</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotal-differences/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 13:27:32 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotal-differences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve been able to create subtotals in Crunch for a long time, and they’re great for quickly seeing what proportion of respondents hold similar views, such as any level of agreement with a statement or any level of liking of a brand etc. But sometimes you also need to take into account the strength of &lt;em&gt;opposing&lt;/em&gt; views — those who disagree or those who dislike, and for that you want to sum those who agree and take away the sum of those who disagree, leaving you with an overall measure you can use for simple comparisons. The well-known Net Promoter Score™ measure works in this way. For dataset editors, Crunch now supports these calculated differences and you create them in a very similar way to how you create regular subtotals:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Perform trend analysis on wave data</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/trend-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 01:33:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/trend-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In time series analysis, we want to be able to identify trends. As we collect data, random fluctuations can obfuscate a trend. &lt;em&gt;Smoothing&lt;/em&gt; is an analytic process whereby we ‘iron out’ differences between time periods by taking the average of previous periods. This is also known as a &lt;em&gt;moving average.&lt;/em&gt; You can now apply smoothing to your analyses with just a few clicks. In the smoothing tab accessed by clicking ⋮ select ‘One-sided moving average’ and choose the number of periods to ‘look back’ at each point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Export dashboards or the tabs you want, with the new selective tab exports feature</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/selective-tab-exports/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 14:06:06 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/selective-tab-exports/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exporting from dashboards just got more flexible. Instead of always having to export the whole dashboard, users are now able to choose between exporting the whole dashboard (still the default), exporting the currently viewed tab, or choosing a custom selection of one or more tabs to export.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new, simplified “Export…” option opens the new Export panel which gives the choice of PowerPoint or Excel formats, but for dashboards with tabs, it also now contains a “Tabs” control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Combine categories in dashboard filter variables</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/multiple-selections-in-groups/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2020 16:54:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/multiple-selections-in-groups/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Groups on dashboards can now optionally allow multiple category selections to effectively combine categories in the filter. Dashboard editors can set an option on the configuration screen for dashboard “Groups” that allows users to make multiple selections within each variable. For example, if you choose an age categories variable as a group and turn on this new option, the dashboard users will be able to select both “18–24” and “25–34” simultaneously, thereby creating a filter that includes anyone aged 18–34.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Customize your tables for export or dashboards</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/editable-tables/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:20:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/editable-tables/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve already been able to customize saved &lt;em&gt;graphs&lt;/em&gt;, but now you can make those same edits to the rows and columns of saved tables, either for export or for display in dashboards. More specifically, you can now&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hide any rows and/or columns of a table, including calculated rows/columns such as subtotals, leaving only those you want your export/dashboard consumers to see. Simply uncheck the box next to the row/column to hide it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reorder the rows/columns of a table, just by dragging them into their new order.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rename any row/column just by typing into the name box. Great for cases where the labels are too long or contain unwanted content.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Together, these features allow you to turn off rows and columns in &amp;lsquo;messy&amp;rsquo; tables. For example, the table below has many columns that the researcher may not want to display in the analysis. They may want to focus the viewer&amp;rsquo;s attention on what&amp;rsquo;s most important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/slides-editable-from-deck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you create an analysis, you may need to edit it further for a PowerPoint export: for example, perhaps you want to hide &amp;lsquo;Not sure&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Prefer not to answer&amp;rsquo; categories, rename long labels, re-order the categories, give the whole analysis a descriptive title, or even simply change the coloring. You can now make these adjustments and more, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find all of those changes reflected in your PowerPoint and Excel exports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Show value labels on graphs</title>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/show-value-labels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Users can now decide whether to show value labels for graphs and charts, both in Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode and on dashboards. Value labels are these small numbers on graphs that show you the value represented by that bar/column/segment&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;img-fluid&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dev/features/images/value-labels-on-chart.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the new feature turned on, these value labels will be displayed on all graphs you create. With the feature turned off (the default), the user needs to hover over a chart element to see a tool-tip with this value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Create the interaction of two variables</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/interaction-builder/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2019 20:56:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/interaction-builder/</guid>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;float-md-right img-fluid&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dev/features/images/interact-variable-result.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To look in detail at your data, you sometimes need to create a variable that is the &lt;em&gt;interaction&lt;/em&gt; of other categorical variables. You want to know not just how results differ between age groups or education level, but by age × education. The Crunch application lets you do this in just a few clicks by selecting the variables to interact — give the result a name (or accept the default of ‘x by y’) and you’re set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
