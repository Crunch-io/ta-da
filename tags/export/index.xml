      <description>Crunch gives you the best of all worlds — you analyze all your survey data in Crunch, and now you can export those results into your other reporting tools (such as Tableau, Google Data Studio, PowerBI) so that you can see your survey results alongside your other business metrics.
Your tables (tab books) can now be exported in a specialized output format. This format contains a row for each cell of the table you see in the Crunch app.</description>

      <description>Crunch tab book exports now include a new hypothesis testing option that computes all possible comparisons between columns of a two-way table. When users select the &amp;ldquo;Column t-test&amp;rdquo; option in the “Export tab book… &amp;gt; Customize” panel, columns in output will be lettered and differences that are significant at the .05 significance level are indicated by letters underneath the cell with the higher percentage. See here for details.
 An example of the exported result is shown below.</description>

      <title>Tab Book Improvements</title>

      <description>We first released the tab book feature a while back, and since then, we’ve collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Tab books produce a static set of tables out of many variables and put results in an Excel sheet, for offline use when you don’t need interactive features like new filters or different weights. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the “export tab book” panel.</description>
