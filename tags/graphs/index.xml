      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When editing a dashboard, you already have access to lots of great customizations via the existing tabs of the “Edit Tile” interface – Properties, Categories and Colors. For most visualization types, you’ll now find a fourth tab – Options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;img-fluid center&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://player-crunch-io.s3.amazonaws.com/help-crunch-io/screenshots/options_tab.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-options-tab&#34;&gt;The new Options tab&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The contents of this tab will include most of the following options, though the actual set will vary depending on the visualization type you’re working with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quickly grab a copy of the current visualization or tile</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to announce a great new feature in response to user feedback which will save you time when you just want a quick copy of the table, graph or dashboard tile on-screen, ready to insert into an email to a colleague or a presentation slide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The existing export options for fully editable Excel tables and PowerPoint slides remain available, but now you have new options within dashboards, Variable Summaries mode and Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode. Each enables you to quickly generate a PNG image of the current tile, table or visualization and then choose whether to download it to your computer or copy it to your clipboard ready to paste elsewhere. Here’s how each one appears…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bring your graphs to life with new mouse hover behavior</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/graph-hover-behavior/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/graph-hover-behavior/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find that Crunch graphs now respond to hovering your mouse over the lines, bars and segments. The hovered part will retain full opacity while the other lines, bars or segments will fade, making it easier to clearly see the data of interest. This applies to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Single variable bar graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grouped bar graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stacked bar graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Donut graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Line graphs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also hover over the legend items to have Crunch highlight that ‘series’ or category. It can be particularly helpful for crowded line graphs, making the path of any individual line much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bringing the Enhanced Bar Plot capabilities to Grouped Bar Plots</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-grouped-bar-plots/</link>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-grouped-bar-plots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-matters&#34;&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your survey data is crucial to making informed decisions. While Crunch has always been at the forefront of providing survey analytics tools, we believe that data visualization can play a more prominent role in the research process. That’s why we&amp;rsquo;ve revamped our grouped bar plots to bring you an even more intuitive and insightful experience, bringing them in line with the enhancements already brought to univariate bar plots.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Easily Toggle Between Subtotals, Categories, or Both</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotals-toggle/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2023 16:45:21 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotals-toggle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;re adding an interface enhancement that brings the existing functionality of toggling between subtotals, categories, or both in tables and graphs, right at your fingertips. Although not new, our user testing revealed that many users were unaware of this feature, and we believe this more visible placement will make it more obvious and easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can now choose from these options via dedicated icons in the main Display Controller panel, making your data viewing and analysis more straightforward and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Enhanced Bar Plots in Crunch – Best Practice in Survey Data Visualization</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-bar-plots/</link>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-bar-plots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to announce a significant update that will enhance the way you visualize and interpret your survey data. Our Upgraded Bar Plots have been redesigned with a cleaner layout, more easily readable text, and now feature the display of confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-this-matters&#34;&gt;Why This Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding your survey data is crucial to making informed decisions. While Crunch has always been at the forefront of providing survey analytics tools, we believe that data visualization can play a more prominent role in the research process. That’s why we&amp;rsquo;ve revamped our univariate bar plots to bring you an even more intuitive and insightful experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crunch&#39;s new visualizations for time-series analyses and trackers are now extended to Date/Time variables</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/date-time-variables/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:39:46 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/date-time-variables/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in April this year, we announced that a great new visualization was available for time series analyses that used the new &amp;ldquo;Categorical Date&amp;rdquo; variable type. Existing time plots that used the older Date/Time variable type were unaffected and continued to use the previous line graph component. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve worked to extend the new line graph functionality to those original Date/Time variables so that everyone can benefit from their better design and functionality, and we can now announce that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; time plots will be using the new visualization. Below you will find a summary of what you can expect from your new time plots in Crunch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sort your graph categories automatically</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/sort-by-value/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 11:27:47 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/sort-by-value/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve been able to sort categories in &lt;em&gt;tables&lt;/em&gt; in Crunch for a long time, but previously when you switched to a graph, that sorting was lost and the graph would show the categories in their original variable order. Now, the sorting you apply in a table will be carried through into a graph when you switch visualization type, as well as being made part of the analysis definition when you save a graph to the deck. That means that the sorted order will show in dashboards, including when you apply a filter, and in PowerPoint exports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Perform trend analysis on wave data</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/trend-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 01:33:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/trend-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In time series analysis, we want to be able to identify trends. As we collect data, random fluctuations can obfuscate a trend. &lt;em&gt;Smoothing&lt;/em&gt; is an analytic process whereby we ‘iron out’ differences between time periods by taking the average of previous periods. This is also known as a &lt;em&gt;moving average.&lt;/em&gt; You can now apply smoothing to your analyses with just a few clicks. In the smoothing tab accessed by clicking ⋮ select ‘One-sided moving average’ and choose the number of periods to ‘look back’ at each point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Use custom color palettes for your saved analyses</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/color-palettes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 16:50:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/color-palettes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been possible for some time to set custom colors for saved analyses in Crunch, but it&amp;rsquo;s been necessary to do this on a one-by-one basis which can be laborious and open to inconsistency. We now offer the ability to create custom color palettes, defined at the organization level, at folder levels, or both, which apply your chosen colors to newly created analyses as well as offering alternatives (e.g. for scales) that can be applied easily, as needed for particular analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Perfect your PowerPoint decks with many new edit controls</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/slides-editable-from-deck/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 18:47:50 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/slides-editable-from-deck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you create an analysis, you may need to edit it further for a PowerPoint export: for example, perhaps you want to hide &amp;lsquo;Not sure&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Prefer not to answer&amp;rsquo; categories, rename long labels, re-order the categories, give the whole analysis a descriptive title, or even simply change the coloring. You can now make these adjustments and more, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find all of those changes reflected in your PowerPoint and Excel exports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Show value labels on graphs</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/show-value-labels/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 15:19:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/show-value-labels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Users can now decide whether to show value labels for graphs and charts, both in Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode and on dashboards. Value labels are these small numbers on graphs that show you the value represented by that bar/column/segment&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;img-fluid&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dev/features/images/value-labels-on-chart.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the new feature turned on, these value labels will be displayed on all graphs you create. With the feature turned off (the default), the user needs to hover over a chart element to see a tool-tip with this value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PowerPoint Deck Exports</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/pptx-exports/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 10:20:47 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/pptx-exports/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We know that for many, PowerPoint slides remain central to delivering results and to paraphrase Mark Twain, &amp;ldquo;reports of PowerPoint&amp;rsquo;s death have been greatly exagerated&amp;rdquo;. Crunch has long offered exports of analyses and tab books to Excel files, which, in addition to their own value, enabled people to get results from Crunch to PowerPoint by copying a cell range from Excel into a slide. That’s a bit tedious, though, and we wanted to do better, which is why we are excited to announce that PowerPoint exports from Crunch are now available if you have &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.crunch.io/crunch/crunch_user-display-settings.html#early-access&#34;&gt;‘Early access’&lt;/a&gt; enabled in the app. We’re eager for feedback, so please try it and let us know how we can improve it to make it truly awesome for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Dashboards</title>
      <link>//crunch.io/dev/features/dataset-dashboard/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Oct 2017 23:20:47 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/dataset-dashboard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crunch is designed to make data accessible to many different audiences that have varying needs, expectations, and technical abilities.&#xA;Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.crunch.io/crunch/crunch_browsing.html&#34;&gt;browse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://support.crunch.io/crunch/crunch_analyzing-data.html&#34;&gt;analyze&lt;/a&gt; views allow data owners and analysts to quickly explore and analyze interesting insights in potentially large, complex datasets. However, not everyone has time to explore a dataset&amp;mdash;some need to see key findings at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To meet this executive-type need, we&amp;rsquo;re introducing a new dashboard feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/visual-updates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve been working on updating and improving the look of Crunch, and we wanted to take moment to call out a few of the recent improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-start-at-the-top&#34;&gt;Let’s start at the top&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that we recently updated the Crunch header.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;img-fluid mx-auto md-block&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dev/features/images/VizNewHeader.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This new top bar provides a more unified look throughout the application, and allows us to move user settings, dataset settings, and project settings into unobtrusive and consistently located dropdown menus. Now, you can click the dataset or project name for actions related to it, while user settings and signing out are accessed by clicking the 3 vertical dots in the upper right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
