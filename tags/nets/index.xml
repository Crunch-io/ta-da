      <description>&lt;p&gt;Subtotals have been a feature of Crunch for years, and calculated differences were added to the feature set in May 2021. They&amp;rsquo;ve been popular features in tables and thanks to this latest release, they&amp;rsquo;re now available in graphs too. Both subtotals and differences can now be displayed in graphs in Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode, as well as on dashboards and in PPTX exports, giving you the flexibility to display, save and report these summary statistics just like any other variable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Add subtotals to multiple response variables</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dataset editors have been able to add subtotals (a.k.a. “nets”) to categorical and categorical array variables for a long time, but this hasn’t been the case for multiple response variables. There are many applications for subtotals on multiple response variables — a common one is a group of products or sub-brands within a brand, or a grouping of statements into themes. Previously, users had to define new variables with often complex logic to describe each combination, and then hide the input variable. Now, Crunch provides a way to specify combinations of items directly on multiple response variables. And even better, these subtotal categories will appear on graphs in Crunch, including on time-series graphs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve been able to create subtotals in Crunch for a long time, and they’re great for quickly seeing what proportion of respondents hold similar views, such as any level of agreement with a statement or any level of liking of a brand etc. But sometimes you also need to take into account the strength of &lt;em&gt;opposing&lt;/em&gt; views — those who disagree or those who dislike, and for that you want to sum those who agree and take away the sum of those who disagree, leaving you with an overall measure you can use for simple comparisons. The well-known Net Promoter Score™ measure works in this way. For dataset editors, Crunch now supports these calculated differences and you create them in a very similar way to how you create regular subtotals:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Subtotals for Categorical Data</title>

      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;float-md-right img-fluid&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dev/features/images/subtotals-diversity.png&#34; width=&#34;250px&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Crunch, we are constantly searching for ways to help our customers&amp;mdash;and their clients&amp;mdash;gain insights from their data. A common task in the market-research world is to take data that is essentially a scale&amp;mdash;rate from 1 to 10, or an ordinal range of responses from &amp;ldquo;Strongly agree&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Strongly disagree&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and collapse it into a smaller number of bins. For example, if you asked people to rate their preference on a scale of 1-10 you might want to see how the people who provide a rating between 1 and 5 compare to those who rated it between 6 and 10. This goes by a number of names like &lt;em&gt;Top Box&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Top Two Box&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Nets&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
