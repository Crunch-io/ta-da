    "description": "Stephen (YouGov Singapore office director) asks: \"Is there any way to change or append the name of the variable when it’s saved to a deck? See attached crunch_deck for example of what I’m talking about. The use case is that we’re starting to use the decks feature a lot more with clients, but we often save slightly different treatments of the same variable to the deck. I noticed the decks do indicate additional variables added as columns or tabs, but not as filters. So If I save 1 variable twice, one with a filter and one without, it still shows the same variable name in the deck. It would be great if the save feature appends a filter label to the variable when saved as well. But even better than that would be the ability to create a custom name for the saved variable.\"",
