      <description>&lt;p&gt;A collaboration between professors from three universities set out to deliver a series of reports entitled, “The State of the Nation: A 50-State COVID-19 Survey”.  Survey data was collected from over 20,000 individuals, who responded to questions about reopening, mitigation, health guidelines, and more, with the survey running every two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Director of Polling at one of the universities involved with the project reached out to Crunch.io for an easy-to-use survey tool that could integrate data from multiple sources, including national and state databases. &lt;span class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;With Crunch.io’s intuitive, &lt;span class=&#34;font-italic&#34;&gt;simple&lt;/span&gt; interface, the team quickly learned how to navigate the platform and run analysis, create &lt;span class=&#34;font-italic&#34;&gt;crosstabs&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;font-italic&#34;&gt;visualizations&lt;/span&gt;, export analyzes to editable PowerPoint objects, and provide key insights for the informative reports.&lt;/span&gt; The analysis has been shared with, and available from, multiple media outlets, including Business Insider, Washington Post, and USA Today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
