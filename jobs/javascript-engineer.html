        <h2>Senior JavaScript Engineer</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Crunch.io seeks a senior frontend developer, experienced in JavaScript, to play a leading role in architecting and building our single-page application for data exploration and interactive graphics. This is challenging yet fun work on user interfaces, API design, and data visualization, operating at the cutting edge of web technologies.</p>
            <p>We are a top-notch team of engineers and statisticians who believe that data preparation and analysis should be instant, visual, and collaborative. We have proven experience in delivering fast, compelling insights from large datasets, and we&#8217;re building on that experience to create a platform for statistics in the cloud.</p>
            <p>This position is a great fit for you if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li dir="ltr">You are a programmer first and web designer second. You write beautiful, interactive, scalable software&#8212;software that just happens to run in a web browser.</li>
                <li dir="ltr">You have a passion for data, for building tools to work with data, or for building tools that more generally help people solve problems effortlessly.</li>
                <li dir="ltr">You thrive on the intensity and energy that can only come from working with talented peers in a startup environment.</li>
                <li dir="ltr">You&#8217;re looking for a full-time position, not a freelance gig.</li>

            <p>Requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li dir="ltr">Expert-level skills in JavaScript and a deep understanding of Angular.js: its strengths, its pitfalls, and its development trajectory</li>
                <li dir="ltr">Demonstrated experience in developing large-scale, single-page web applications</li>
                <li dir="ltr">Strong leadership and communication skills</li>
                <li dir="ltr">Serious commitment to high development standards, including comprehensive testing, in whatever language you&#8217;re working; in JavaScript, experience with Jasmine, Mocha, or other testing framework</li>
                <li dir="ltr">A Bachelor&#8217;s degree or equivalent in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, or related</li>
                <li dir="ltr">Special talents for Python, CSS3, and HTTP API design will make you stand out</li>
