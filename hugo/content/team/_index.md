History, from YouGov/industry

Our business model is to make a product people want and then sell it to them. We solve real problems that real people have.

We are a small team, which means that everyone wears multiple hats, and your work has instant, direct effects on our users. That is very satisfying.

# Remote-first

While our origins are in the San Francisco Bay Area, our team is completely remote. Most of us are in the Americas, but we range from Australia to Poland.

Meetups, travel

# Our culture

But despite being a small team, Crunch is not the typical startup experience. We are adults with lives, families, and wide-ranging interests outside of work. We value hard work and expect serious contribution from our teammates, but we also recognize that building a sustainable, lovable product is more of a marathon than a sprint, and we actively discourage unhealthy work habits.

We value automation so that we can offload tedious, repetitive tasks to computers and focus our energies on problems needing creative solutions. We value testing so that we never have to fix the same bug twice, and so that we are free to refactor and improve our code without fear of unintended consequences. We follow the ["Boy Scout rule"](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule) and leave the codebase cleaner than we found it whenever we make changes.

We come from diverse backgrounds. And when we hire people, we value experience and education
