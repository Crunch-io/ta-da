### What it's like to work at Crunch:

To provide continuous improvement for our clients, we work hard to make our development platform work as smoothly as possible.  One of our goals is for our developers to be able to ship a small amount of code on day 1.  You can expect to meet with your peers for a short standup daily.  From there you might be helping make design decisions, reviewing some code, writing code to create a new feature or expand on the one you wrote last week.  Since we are all remote, the majority of up to the minute communication in topic-specific chat rooms, but we often will meet face to face on to discuss a topic or demonstrate a new feature with screen sharing.  We also meet physically at regular intervals for short stints to work together in person.
  
Since our development process is continuous, there are no hold-ups when your work is ready for prime-time.  Not only does this make the process of bringing new features into the fold less onerous, it also means fixing problems you or others find more satisfying.  Continuous development also means that your days can vary as much as you want them to.  Crave consistency?  Code in the morning and ship in the afternoon every day.  Sometimes need downtime in the afternoon?  Maybe that's a good time to schedule some offline code review.  By creating an atmosphere where talented people can thrive in ways that works for them, we meet our goals and our clients need more quickly than we would with a more rigid system.
