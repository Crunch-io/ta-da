Crunch is seeking talented, motivated, and versatile software developers to help build our next-generation dataset-management platform, all the way from physical bits to complete analyses and visualizations. You would work with the rest of our team to design and implement novel features that deliver real value and change our clients’ workflows for the better. We’re looking for people who like to write beautiful, interactive, scalable software that just happens to run in a web browser. Both technical and aesthetic details matter greatly to you, and you want to surround yourself with talented peers who share your dedication.

### Qualifications:

* Experience in JavaScript and Python, strength in at least one of the two, and a drive to continually improve your abilities in both
* Commitment to high coding standards, including comprehensive testing, in whatever language you're working
* Demonstrated ability to work with a team of peers, understanding and respecting the responsibilities and expertise that developers, designers, QA folks, and others all bring to the project
* Ability to provide reasonable estimates on work, meet deadlines, and take ownership and responsibility

In any given week, you might add API features, interact with and refine the same API by consuming it in the JavaScript app, review your colleagues’ work and suggest improvements where you have special expertise, and fix a bug in an area you improved last week. You take some time to evaluate a promising new library, and start to plan how to use it in one of our subsystems. Full-stack engineers, even though they will specialize, gain broad familiarity with the entire system, and take pride in writing solid, thoroughly tested, and readable code.

Most of our stack is Python, with AngularJS in the browser. We also support R and Python client libraries. If you have experience or interest in these other areas, they may also be part of the job:

* ElasticSearch
* The AWS ecosystem
* MongoDB
* High-performance and numerical computing
* End-to-end testing (we use Nightwatch.js and Sauce Labs)
