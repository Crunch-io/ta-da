      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/fix-categories-when-sorting/</guid>
      <description>We understand that when creating analyses for export or dashboards, certain answer categories carry different significance. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;, “Other” and &amp;ldquo;None of these&amp;rdquo; are three such examples that often require special handling. With Crunch&amp;rsquo;s latest feature, you can now effortlessly fix these categories, or any others of your choosing, to the end of your lists when sorting, ensuring that they are sensibly placed at the end and not merged in amongst your brand lists, attitude statements, etc.</description>

      <description>Dataset Views: Quickly Create, Deliver, and Share Data Subsets&#xA;It’s increasingly common to collect data for multiple clients or multiple groups of stakeholders in one single survey. Whether for an Omnibus product, a syndicated data product or simply different regional groupings, it can be challenging to meet the different data needs of these client and stakeholder groups with a single dataset. To meet this need, Crunch has developed Dataset Views.</description>

      <title>Subtotals and calculated differences can now be shown on graphs</title>

      <description>Subtotals have been a feature of Crunch for years, and calculated differences were added to the feature set in May 2021. They&amp;rsquo;ve been popular features in tables and thanks to this latest release, they&amp;rsquo;re now available in graphs too. Both subtotals and differences can now be displayed in graphs in Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode, as well as on dashboards and in PPTX exports, giving you the flexibility to display, save and report these summary statistics just like any other variable.</description>

      <description>Crunch gives you the best of all worlds — you analyze all your survey data in Crunch, and now you can export those results into your other reporting tools (such as Tableau, Google Data Studio, PowerBI) so that you can see your survey results alongside your other business metrics.&#xA;Your tables (tab books) can now be exported in a specialized output format. This format contains a row for each cell of the table you see in the Crunch app.</description>

      <title>Create a grouping (array) of numeric variables for easy comparison</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 14:05:22 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/numeric-arrays/</guid>
      <description>Numeric Arrays enable you to work efficiently with groups of numeric variables that are related. For example, you might have asked your respondents for the number of times they have engaged with each of a list of activities, or asked for how many times they&amp;rsquo;ve purchased each of a list of products, or asked for a numeric rating for how much they agree with a list of statements. In each case, the data collected consist of a set of numeric values.</description>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotals-mr/</guid>
      <description>Dataset editors have been able to add subtotals (a.k.a. “nets”) to categorical and categorical array variables for a long time, but this hasn’t been the case for multiple response variables. There are many applications for subtotals on multiple response variables — a common one is a group of products or sub-brands within a brand, or a grouping of statements into themes. Previously, users had to define new variables with often complex logic to describe each combination, and then hide the input variable.</description>

      <title>Crunch&#39;s new visualizations for time-series analyses and trackers are now extended to Date/Time variables</title>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/date-time-variables/</guid>
      <description>Back in April this year, we announced that a great new visualization was available for time series analyses that used the new &amp;ldquo;Categorical Date&amp;rdquo; variable type. Existing time plots that used the older Date/Time variable type were unaffected and continued to use the previous line graph component. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve worked to extend the new line graph functionality to those original Date/Time variables so that everyone can benefit from their better design and functionality, and we can now announce that all time plots will be using the new visualization.</description>

      <description>You’ve been able to sort categories in tables in Crunch for a long time, but previously when you switched to a graph, that sorting was lost and the graph would show the categories in their original variable order. Now, the sorting you apply in a table will be carried through into a graph when you switch visualization type, as well as being made part of the analysis definition when you save a graph to the deck.</description>

      <description>You’ve been able to create subtotals in Crunch for a long time, and they’re great for quickly seeing what proportion of respondents hold similar views, such as any level of agreement with a statement or any level of liking of a brand etc. But sometimes you also need to take into account the strength of opposing views — those who disagree or those who dislike, and for that you want to sum those who agree and take away the sum of those who disagree, leaving you with an overall measure you can use for simple comparisons.</description>

      <description>Line graphs are great at showing how values are changing over time and therefore ideal for tracking studies. Crunch&amp;rsquo;s line graphs have been completely redesigned to offer some great new features as well as improved usability and flexibility.&#xA;Category selection&#xA;Line graphs become really hard to read when there are lots of lines shown simultaneously, so Crunch now defaults to showing just the top 5, but you can pick whichever combination of lines (including showing more or fewer than 5) from the new &amp;ldquo;Select categories&amp;rdquo; interface.</description>

      <guid>//crunch.io/blog/automation/crunch-automation/</guid>
      <description>Crunch Automation serves as a declarative history of transformations that have been done to a dataset. This is important to understand, because it informs you how you go about writing, running, editing and replicating datasets.&#xA;With SPSS syntax, it&#xA;directly manipulates an SPSS datafile (eg: .sav file) is not designed with survey analysis in mind doesn’t set up derivations like Crunch does (it hard-codes anything you do as a new variable) doesn’t stay with the datafile (you keep your syntax separate from the datafile), and, importantly, alters your variables by overwriting the already-hard-coded variables with more syntax (which you can do endlessly) Crunch Automation is the opposite in these respects.</description>

      <description>The sharing options for a dataset have been simplified and consolidated. Previously, both Share and Members links were visible to Dataset Editors. To simplify, Dataset Editors can only now see the Members link. The Share link option for Dataset Editors has been removed.&#xA;For Dataset Viewers, the sharing option with Share link has not changed.&#xA;Below we have outlined how you can share a dataset for different permission levels: Editors and Viewers.</description>

      <description>Back in September, we added a variety of advanced calculations to include in tab books (exported multitables) and other options to customize the exported tables. We&amp;rsquo;ve now added these same customization options to tables saved to (and exported from) the deck.&#xA;This can be helpful if you need to:&#xA;Show more than one measure (percentages, counts, indices, Z-scores, population estimates) at once, or&#xA;Have additional elements or measures included in your exports, such as pairwise comparison letters (ABCD), standard deviations, standard errors, etc.</description>

      <description>In time series analysis, we want to be able to identify trends. As we collect data, random fluctuations can obfuscate a trend. Smoothing is an analytic process whereby we ‘iron out’ differences between time periods by taking the average of previous periods. This is also known as a moving average. You can now apply smoothing to your analyses with just a few clicks. In the smoothing tab accessed by clicking ⋮ select ‘One-sided moving average’ and choose the number of periods to ‘look back’ at each point.</description>

      <title>Greater flexibility to customize tab books</title>

      <description>You can now choose a variety of advanced calculations to include in tab books (exported multitables) and other options to customize the exported tables. Table cells can now contain estimates of standard deviation and standard error, and column summaries can include the median of numeric values as well as the standard deviation for the column and standard error of the mean. Pairwise column significance tests can be conducted at the standard 0.</description>

      <title>Export dashboards or the tabs you want, with the new selective tab exports feature</title>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/selective-tab-exports/</guid>
      <description>Exporting from dashboards just got more flexible. Instead of always having to export the whole dashboard, users are now able to choose between exporting the whole dashboard (still the default), exporting the currently viewed tab, or choosing a custom selection of one or more tabs to export.&#xA;The new, simplified “Export…” option opens the new Export panel which gives the choice of PowerPoint or Excel formats, but for dashboards with tabs, it also now contains a “Tabs” control.</description>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/multiple-selections-in-groups/</guid>
      <description>The Groups on dashboards can now optionally allow multiple category selections to effectively combine categories in the filter. Dashboard editors can set an option on the configuration screen for dashboard “Groups” that allows users to make multiple selections within each variable. For example, if you choose an age categories variable as a group and turn on this new option, the dashboard users will be able to select both “18–24” and “25–34” simultaneously, thereby creating a filter that includes anyone aged 18–34.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve already been able to customize saved graphs, but now you can make those same edits to the rows and columns of saved tables, either for export or for display in dashboards. More specifically, you can now&amp;hellip;&#xA;Hide any rows and/or columns of a table, including calculated rows/columns such as subtotals, leaving only those you want your export/dashboard consumers to see. Simply uncheck the box next to the row/column to hide it.</description>

      <title>Easily create and recombine categorical arrays and multiple response variables</title>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/new-multiple-response-cat-array-builder/</guid>
      <description>Array variables allow you to analyze together a set of variables that share a common structure and theme. For example, surveys often ask respondents to use a common scale to rate or respond to different prompts, sometimes in a grid, all sharing a common set of response categories. When analyzing the data, a categorical array variable lets users see all the items together. This structure allows users to easily compare lists of brands against a common set of attributes, or compare a set of statements against a common agreement scale — something that is much harder to do with distinct categorical variables.</description>

      <guid>//crunch.io/dev/features/color-palettes/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been possible for some time to set custom colors for saved analyses in Crunch, but it&amp;rsquo;s been necessary to do this on a one-by-one basis which can be laborious and open to inconsistency. We now offer the ability to create custom color palettes, defined at the organization level, at folder levels, or both, which apply your chosen colors to newly created analyses as well as offering alternatives (e.g. for scales) that can be applied easily, as needed for particular analyses.</description>

      <description>When you create an analysis, you may need to edit it further for a PowerPoint export: for example, perhaps you want to hide &amp;lsquo;Not sure&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Prefer not to answer&amp;rsquo; categories, rename long labels, re-order the categories, give the whole analysis a descriptive title, or even simply change the coloring. You can now make these adjustments and more, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find all of those changes reflected in your PowerPoint and Excel exports.</description>

      <description>Users can now decide whether to show value labels for graphs and charts, both in Tables &amp;amp; Graphs mode and on dashboards. Value labels are these small numbers on graphs that show you the value represented by that bar/column/segment&amp;hellip;&#xA;With the new feature turned on, these value labels will be displayed on all graphs you create. With the feature turned off (the default), the user needs to hover over a chart element to see a tool-tip with this value.</description>

      <description>Dashboards can now contain KPI analyses that take a single value from a table and present it in a tile. Great for when there&amp;rsquo;s a key metric you want to highlight or track.&#xA;Dataset editors can now add KPI analyses like these to dashboards. This allows you to show a key company metric – e.g. Brand Awareness – as a prominent value that grabs attention.&#xA;To create one, simply save an analysis of any kind – table, chart or variable card – that contains the value you want to show as a KPI.</description>

      <description>To look in detail at your data, you sometimes need to create a variable that is the interaction of other categorical variables. You want to know not just how results differ between age groups or education level, but by age × education. The Crunch application lets you do this in just a few clicks by selecting the variables to interact — give the result a name (or accept the default of ‘x by y’) and you’re set.</description>

      <description>Dataset editors can add one or more variables to be used as filters across an entire dashboard with a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows all dashboard viewers to get more out of your dashboards by customizing their view of the data. For example:&#xA;Add demographic variables such as gender, age, education level, region, and ethnicity to allow your viewers to drill down on the customer populations that interest them.</description>

      <description>Tables in the application now let you set a column as the basis of comparison, shading the table to show which other columns are higher or lower than the reference column, and to what level of statistical significance. The test is a two-tailed t test comparing each column proportion in turn to the proportion in the reference column. In a multitable, the test is conducted between categories within each column variable, and not across column variables.</description>

      <description>What are Crunch dashboards? A dashboard is a special view of your data that has been prepared with pre-made analyses — tables and graphs — designed to highlight key points for instant insight. Dashboards are great for conveying key information, drawn from your data, for users who don’t have the time (or the inclination) to do their own analysis. Crunch dashboards allow you to combine your important findings into a single display, perfect for sharing with colleagues and other end users.</description>

      <description>Crunch web application Made the following updates: Test statistics for pairwise hypothesis tests (‘set comparison’ or lettered indicators in exports) of weighted tables now account for the design effect of weights. This makes the tests more conservative by considering the effective sample size instead of the unadjusted unweighted N. When a dataset editor creates a new dashboard via the dataset Automation option, the editor&amp;rsquo;s current container in the tray is now updated to that dashboard.</description>

      <description>Crunch web application Updated the design of the Dataset Properties menu — it now includes many dataset actions that are available directly from the dataset menu.

      <description>Crunch web application Enabled users with ‘Editor’ permissions to add, modify, and remove a PowerPoint template on a folder. Previously, only account admins had permission to manage a PPT template. Removed the ability to directly share datasets that are created in personal folders.

      <description>Crunch web application Fixed the following: Navigation between dashboard tabs was not working correctly. Hidden columns became visible after performing a column sort on a dashboard tile. Qualtrics integrations: Fixed an issue where Qualtrics fields in a loop-and-merge integration were not sequential (i.e., the index in the list of fields did not correspond to the id of the CSV header). Added support for “Authenticator” blocks that Qualtrics added to survey flows.</description>

      <description>Crunch web application Fixed the following: The summary row would not change from ‘Unweighted N’ to ‘Weighted N’ (or ‘Both’) when viewing in multitable view. Performance was slow when loading certain multitables. The rendering of numeric variables did not appear correctly when they have a valid count equal to zero. Variable names are now transformed into aliases when creating them though the Crunch web UI — the automatically-generated alias for the variable will no longer be an exact copy of the name of the variable.</description>

      <description>Crunch web application Fixed the following: A color assignment was sometimes incorrectly applied in PowerPoint exports when the categories for the analysis had been reordered. The selection of a single column for pairwise-comparison hypothesis testing sometimes caused multiple columns to be shaded as reference columns. Added support for low base warnings and suppression for numeric array analyses. Crunch Automation Added the following new folder script commands: SET command — allows you to change the value of a particular folder setting.</description>

      <description>Crunch web application Fixed the following: The ‘Save’ and tray buttons would occasionally disappear. The mean of a categorical-scale univariate analysis was incorrectly suppressed when the ‘minimum base size warn’ handling was enabled. Mean cell values that were below the minimum base size for the warn scenario were incorrectly exported as percentages. In the extended settings of the Display Controller, the checkboxes for Subtotals, Categories, and Both have been replaced by radio buttons, which better reflect the single-choice nature of these options.</description>

      <description>Crunch web application Fixed the following: Changes made to the subvariable names of a multiple response variable were not persisting correctly. An exclusion filter could be set but not applied during some operations under rare circumstances — the exclusion is now always applied by default to avoid an accidental failure to apply. Editing the title or description for a derived categorical array was not working. The ‘Save’ button for the deck tray could sometimes get stuck in a disabled state.</description>

      <description>Crunch web application Fixed the following: Incorrect cell colors sometimes appeared within three-way tables when switching tabs. Users were not able to open ‘Edit categories’ for logical variables (such as those created via the filter builder). The ‘Edit categories’ option was missing from the variable properties panel for a derived categorical. Categories sometimes could not be renamed in the variable properties panel. The full list of subvariables sometimes did not get displayed on numeric-array variable summary cards.</description>

      <title>PowerPoint Deck Exports</title>

      <description>We know that for many, PowerPoint slides remain central to delivering results and to paraphrase Mark Twain, &amp;ldquo;reports of PowerPoint&amp;rsquo;s death have been greatly exagerated&amp;rdquo;. Crunch has long offered exports of analyses and tab books to Excel files, which, in addition to their own value, enabled people to get results from Crunch to PowerPoint by copying a cell range from Excel into a slide. That’s a bit tedious, though, and we wanted to do better, which is why we are excited to announce that PowerPoint exports from Crunch are now available if you have ‘Early access’ enabled in the app.</description>

      <description>At Crunch, one of the ways we try to make data exploration simple is by providing sensible default views that take into account the properties of your data and metadata. We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of releasing some plotting methods in our crplyr R package that define methods for ggplot2&amp;rsquo;s autoplot() function. autoplot() was the ideal approach for us to encapsulate the logic of how to &amp;ldquo;just do the right thing.&amp;rdquo; You can do the analysis you want, and it will make smart choices about how to display it with no additional input&amp;ndash;all of which you can control or override with additional ggplot2 layers, if you want.</description>

But you don’t have to stop there, you can connect to Crunch and run any model you like, create bespoke visualizations, or even write your own packages. Crunch is a modern survey platform.

      <description>At Crunch, we are constantly searching for ways to help our customers&amp;mdash;and their clients&amp;mdash;gain insights from their data. A common task in the market-research world is to take data that is essentially a scale&amp;mdash;rate from 1 to 10, or an ordinal range of responses from &amp;ldquo;Strongly agree&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Strongly disagree&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and collapse it into a smaller number of bins. For example, if you asked people to rate their preference on a scale of 1-10 you might want to see how the people who provide a rating between 1 and 5 compare to those who rated it between 6 and 10.</description>

      <description>Crunch is designed to make data accessible to many different audiences that have varying needs, expectations, and technical abilities. Our browse and analyze views allow data owners and analysts to quickly explore and analyze interesting insights in potentially large, complex datasets. However, not everyone has time to explore a dataset&amp;mdash;some need to see key findings at a glance.&#xA;To meet this executive-type need, we&amp;rsquo;re introducing a new dashboard feature.&#xA;This dashboard provides a quick view of up to four analyses, right when you open a dataset.</description>

      <description>At Crunch we greatly value tests. We have unit tests, functional tests, and the stack wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be complete without end-to-end tests. Good tests allow us to update code quickly and confidently.&#xA;For our end-to-end testing we use Nightwatch.js, a JavaScript testing tool that uses Selenium to drive a browser to perform tests. Our goal is to be able to test our Python backend, our REST APIs, and the behavior of our JavaScript single-page application, using a real browser, running real code.</description>

      <description>Crunch is designed to make it easy to manage and explore data, and it is particularly optimized for survey data. We natively support data types that are common in survey research, and it is also simple to do things like generate population weights and apply them automatically to all calculations. And the kinds of analyses and reports that are standard among researchers are easily selected and exported.&#xA;These features are great if you work at a research company, or in a marketing department, or otherwise work with surveys professionally.</description>

      <description>A wealth of information can be locked in text data. Our new “sentiment analysis” feature enables you to quantify and analyze just a bit of it: whether the text in question is on balance Positive, Neutral, or Negative — and then crosstab the derived sentiment variable just like any other variable to understand the variations among other groups in the dataset.&#xA;In the properties panel for text variables, you’ll notice the Classify button.</description>

      <title>Deliver New Data When You’re Ready</title>

      <description>Lately we’ve been focusing on ways to make it easier for data owners to manage data for their clients. After all, Crunch isn’t just for analyzing data, it’s a tool for making everything about delivering data to clients faster, smoother, and more powerful.&#xA;To that end, we’ve recently developed a draft and publish feature that allows data owners to make significant changes to data accessible to their clients with minimal interruption to how those clients interact with the data.</description>

      <title>Using Travis-CI to Build Static Sites</title>

      <description>At Crunch.io, we&amp;rsquo;re fervent believers in automation. If something requires a human to remember to do an extra manual step, it won&amp;rsquo;t happen consistently. We automate test running so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to fix the same bug twice. We write code to do tedious tasks so that we can devote our mental energy to harder problems. We automate processes and policies so that developers don&amp;rsquo;t have remember the right things to do—the build and continuous-integration systems guide us.</description>

      <title>Tab Book Improvements</title>

      <description>We first released the tab book feature a while back, and since then, we’ve collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Tab books produce a static set of tables out of many variables and put results in an Excel sheet, for offline use when you don’t need interactive features like new filters or different weights. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the “export tab book” panel.</description>
