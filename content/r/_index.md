At Crunch, we understand that no graphical interface is going to be able to
accomplish every single task that faces an analyst. For instance if you need to
fit a statistical model, perform text analysis, or send data to a downstream
process an open source tool like R is probably the most convenient option. This
is why weâ€™ve designed Crunch around an [accessible API](http://docs.crunch.io/)
and built several R clients for accessing and manipulating data stored in
Crunch. These tools allow you to combine the power and dynamism of the R
ecosystem with the user-friendliness of the Crunch graphical interface.

To learn more about working with Crunch from R, check out our packages:

-   [crunch](/r/crunch/): Our core package for interacting with the Crunch cloud
    service.

-   [crplyr](/r/crplyr): A `dplyr` interface for the
    Crunch backend, allowing for easy data analysis

-   [crunchy](/r/crunchy/): For building Shiny apps on
    Crunch

-   [crunchgeo](https://github.com/Crunch-io/crunchgeo): For working with
    geospatial data in Crunch
