Crunch.io is seeking a curious, meticulous, friendly technical writer work with the rest of our team on a contract basis. Our platform has the potential to transform customers’ archaic workflows — if only they knew how.

Likewise, you’ll work with our engineering teams to make sure that API documentation and usage guides are correct and up to date. Finally, you’ll work with the product team to produce announcement and feature documentation for works in progress as they gather requirements and feedback for our constantly evolving product.
