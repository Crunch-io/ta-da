Crunch.io is an innovative analytics company in the market research industry. We offer a survey data analysis platform that allows market researchers, analysts, and marketers to collaborate in a secure, cloud-based environment, using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Crunch users can quickly gain insights from their data and communicate them to their clients. We are hiring a Customer Experience Manager to help us better support our customers and to improve the product to meet their needs.

In this position, you will

* Provide friendly first line communication with customers
