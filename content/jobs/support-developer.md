Crunch offers a complete survey data analysis platform that allows market researchers, analysts, and marketers to collaborate in a secure, cloud-based environment, using a simple, intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Crunch allows users to  quickly gain insight from their data and communicate those insights to clients. 
Crunch is a well-funded, remote-first company with a collaborative and open culture. We are passionate about our product and our mission, and value work/life balance, efficiency, simplicity, and fantastic customer service.

We are hiring a Customer Experience Manager to help us better understand our customers and to improve the product to meet their needs. 

In this position, you will

Some experience with writing code will help you succeed in the role, and if you want to become a better programmer, you will have plenty of opportunities to grow.
