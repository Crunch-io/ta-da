We are hiring an experienced Site Reliability Engineer to help expand our platform and operations excellence. We are inviting you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators helping make our platform faster, more secure, and more reliable. You will be self-motivated and disciplined in order to work with our fully distributed team.

We are looking for someone who is a quick study, who is eager to learn and grow with us, and who has experience in DevOps and Agile cultures. At Crunch, we believe in learning together: we recognize that we don't have all the answers, and we try to ask each other the right questions. As Crunch employees are completely distributed, it's crucial that you can work well independently, and keep yourself motivated and focused.

**Our stack**

We currently run our in-house production Python code against Redis, MongoDB, and ElasticSearch services. We proxy API requests through NGINX, load balance with ELBs, and deploy our React web application to AWS CloudFront CDN. We use EFS for persistent storage. Our current CI/CD process is built around GitHub, Jenkins, BlueOcean including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests and automated system deployments. We deploy to auto-scaling Groups using Ansible and Cloud-Init.

In the future (and to some degree currently), all or part of our platform will include Kubernetes, Helm, FluxV2, and Spinnaker.

**What you'll do**

- Monitor and detect emerging customer-facing incidents on the Crunch platform; assist in their proactive resolution, and work to prevent them from occurring
- Coordinate and participate in a weekly on-call rotation, where you will handle short term customer incidents (from direct surveillance or through alerts via our Support Engineers)
- Diagnose live incidents, differentiate between platform issues versus usage issues across the entire stack; hardware, software, application and network within physical datacenter and cloud-based environments, take the first steps towards resolution, and see the problem through to resolution
- Automate routine monitoring and troubleshooting tasks
- Provide consistent, high-quality feedback and recommendations to our product managers and development teams regarding product defects or recurring performance issues
- Drive improvements and advancements to the platform in areas such as container orchestration, service mesh, request/retry strategies
- Build frameworks and tools to empower safe, developer-led changes, automate the manual steps and provide insight into our complex system
- Work directly with the team to enhance the performance, scalability and observability of resources of multiple applications and ensure that production handoff requirements are met and escalate issues
- Embed into SRE projects to stay close to the operational workflows and issues
- Evangelize the adoption of best practices in relation to performance and reliability across the organization
- Maintain project and operational workload statistics
- Promote a healthy and functional work environment
- Work with Team Lead and/or external security contractors to do periodic penetration testing, and drive resolution for any issues discovered
- Administer a large portfolio of SaaS tools used throughout the company
- Execute other projects from the Team Lead as needed
