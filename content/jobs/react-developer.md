**Reports to**: Software Delivery Manager

**Work location**: Anywhere, 100% remote

**Direct reports**: 0

We are hiring an Advanced React Developer to help develop our platform. We are inviting you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators helping make our platform faster, more secure, and more reliable. You would help us deliver new features, explore different ways of problem solving, and discover, explain, and defend your choices in implementation. 

At Crunch, we believe in learning together: we recognize that we don’t have all the answers, and we try to ask each other the right questions. Some of the ways that we accomplish that include paired programming to tackle a hard problem, transparent code reviews, and discussions about design and architecture. Since Crunch’s employees are completely distributed, it’s crucial that you can work well independently, and keep yourself motivated and focused. We move fast but carefully, with an earnest commitment to not breaking things… well, not too much.

On the front-end team, we feel strongly about developing solutions that are both technically and aesthetically sound. We invite you to bring your experience and perspective to conversations about the future growth of our applications and environment. We work closely together, with a healthy and non-combative review process aimed at improving code as well as developing each other’s skills. In short, we strive to write solid, thoroughly tested, and readable code; and we are seeking a new member of our already highly-effective team.

**What you'll do**

- Work on new features with other front-end team members.
- Triage, unravel, test, and resolve bugs and issues.
- Update existing code in parallel with backend changes to ensure uninterrupted operation.
- Review your colleagues’ work on pull requests.
- Propose, discuss, and debate technology improvements, code organization, design patterns, and conventions employed in the front-end development environment.
- Use your extensive experience to train and mentor other developers on the front-end team.

**Our stack**

Front-end developers on our platform are first-class team members. Although your focus is primarily on TypeScript, you will gain familiarity with the entire system. Some of the technologies that enable us to achieve our well-designed, efficient, and performant applications are:

- TypeScript (latest specification)
- Webpack + Babel (ES6 modules)
- React + Redux
- Styled Components
- Unit testing with Jest (we have over 5500 unit tests across our app)
- Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment

If you have experience or interest in these additional areas, you may have the opportunity to work with them as part of your role:

- End-to-end testing using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- Responsive design / mobile / touch interfaces

**Basic qualifications**

- Advanced to expert-level React skills with demonstrated experience. 
- A firm command of Typescript.
- Familiarity with JavaScript frameworks and libraries for building web applications.
- Commitment to high development standards, including comprehensive testing.
- Demonstrated ability to work with team of peers, understanding and respecting the responsibilities and expertise that developers, designers, QA staff, and others bring to the project.
- Ability to provide reasonable estimates on work, meet deadlines, and take ownership and responsibility.
- Well-developed principles of self-motivation and time management.
- An appetite for continual improvement and growth.

**Advanced (preferred) qualifications**

- Bachelor’s Degree in Programming, Computer Science, or Engineering-related field.
- Current or former contributor to a significant open-source React library.
