We are looking for talented and motivated new team members in a variety of roles. Below are some more detailed descriptions of some areas that we are especially interested in expanding. Our ambitions are bigger than just what is listed, so if yours are too, please tell us how — you might fit right in!

In any role we’re looking for skills and potential more than pedigree or specific experiences — we come from a variety of backgrounds — but any of the following will likely strengthen your application:

* An imagination — for tools that are better than the ones you have now
* Consideration for users’ needs and a desire to make their work easier
* Demonstrated experience in developing large-scale, single-page web applications
* Special talents for designing highly scalable web services and APIs, Angular, or CSS3
* Leadership, contribution, or participation in well-known open-source projects
* Experience with iterative statistical exploration and modeling
* Interest in machine learning / prediction, in any language(s)
* A love of learning and staying up to date with the tools of the trade — e.g., NumPy, R, Stan, TensorFlow, Elasticsearch, React, scijs, and D3.
* Experience working on a remote-first, distributed team
