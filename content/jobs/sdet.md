**Reports to:** VP Software Engineering

**Work location:** Anywhere

**Employment type:** Contract to Permanent

We are hiring a QA Engineer to help us in three key areas. 

1. We need someone with [cypress.io](http://cypress.io) experience to migrate a few hundred nightwatch.js end-to-end browser/selenium tests to Cypress.io. 
1. We need help writing JavaScript unit tests for our Angular/React front-end to improve our test code coverage to 100%. 
1. We need someone who can work directly with our product managers to design, refine, and implement a better end-to-end testing strategy that covers all of our important user flow and use cases.

We are looking for someone who is a quick study, who is eager to learn and grow with us, and who has experience with these specific activities. At Crunch, we believe in learning together: we recognize that we don’t have all the answers, and we try to ask each other the right questions. As Crunch employees are completely distributed, it’s crucial that you can work well independently, and keep yourself motivated and focused. 

We invite you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators helping make our platform faster, more robust, and more reliable.
