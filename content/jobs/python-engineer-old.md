We are hiring a Python Engineer to help develop our platform. We are inviting you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators helping make our platform faster, more secure, and more reliable. You would help us deliver new features and build the future for how we deploy our products faster and safer while increasing the availability and reliability of our systems. You will explore different ways of problem solving and discover, explain, and defend your choices in implementation. You will be self-motivated and disciplined in order to work with our fully distributed team.

We are looking for someone who is a quick study, who is eager to learn and grow with us, and who has experience in DevOps or Agile cultures. At Crunch, we believe in learning together: we recognize that we don’t have all the answers, and we try to ask each other the right questions. Some of the ways that we accomplish that include paired programming to tackle a hard problem, transparent code reviews, and discussions about design and architecture. Since Crunch’s employees are completely distributed, it’s crucial that you can work well independently, and keep yourself motivated and focused. We move fast but carefully, with an earnest commitment to not breaking things… well, not too much.

# What you'll do:

In addition to typical software engineering tasks, you will be expected to

- Contribute to code quality through unit testing, integration testing, code review, and system design using Python
- Assist in diagnosing and fixing system failures quickly when they occur, in your particular area of expertise. This is limited to when the on-call rotation needs a subject matter expert to help troubleshoot an issue.

# Basic qualifications:

- Ability to work independently and communicate clearly
- A commitment to producing robust, testable code
- Strong programming experience using Python as a programming language
- API design experience
    - Maintain the existing API
    - Think about the shape of the API/endpoints
    - API versioning concerns
- Database experience (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc)
- Experience working in a Linux environment

# Advanced (preferred) qualifications:

- Building large-scale or complex multi-tenant web applications
- Parallelization, code optimization, and Big Data operations
- Numpy experience, strong math skills
- Understanding of distributed computing
- Testing of multi-threaded parallel code
- Experience scaling both horizontally and vertically
- MongoDB
- ElasticSearch
- Background in statistics to understand customer requirements
- pytest testing experience
- Database design (database internals)
- Continuous Integration tools (e.g., Jenkins, Bamboo, Travis, etc)
- R experience to help develop our client libraries consuming the API
