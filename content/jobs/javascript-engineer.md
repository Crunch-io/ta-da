Crunch is seeking talented, motivated front-end engineers to build our interactive data applications. You would work with the rest of our team to help build a product that is changing the way our clients do their work. Both technical and aesthetic details matter greatly to you. (You like to use both arrow functions and en-dashes appropriately.) You want to surround yourself with talented peers who share your dedication. In short, you write solid, thoroughly tested, and readable code.

In an intermediate role, you would get right to work in a complex application that clients depend on to get their jobs done. You would learn to refine not only your own code but our APIs that it works with. You would have growing responsibility for new features and tested bug fixes. In any given week, you might:

* prepare some existing code for an upcoming backend change so nothing breaks
* pair with senior developers to develop new features
* puzzle through a client-reported bug; eventually testing then fixing it

Frontend developers on our platform are first-class team members. Even though you specialize in cutting-edge JavaScript, you’ll gain familiarity with the entire system. We use ES6 with babelify, AngularJS 1.x, Grunt, and Stylus, among many other tools. If you have experience or interest in these other areas, they may also be part of the job:

* End-to-end testing (we use Nightwatch.js and Sauce Labs)
* Mobile design / touch interfaces

### Qualifications:

* Skill in JavaScript and, more importantly, an appetite for continual improvement
* Familiarity with JavaScript frameworks, preferably but not necessarily Angular
* Commitment to high development standards, including comprehensive testing, in whatever language you’re working; in JavaScript, experience with Jasmine, Mocha, or other testing framework is a plus
* Demonstrated ability to work with team of peers, understanding and respecting the responsibilities and expertise developers, designers, QA folks, and others bring to the project
* Ability to provide reasonable estimates on work, meet deadlines, and take ownership and responsibility
