Crunch is seeking talented, motivated front-end engineers to build our interactive data applications. As an engineer at Crunch, you will collaborate with others throughout our organization and technology stack to build products that are revolutionizing the way our clients achieve their business goals. As a part of the front-end team, you care greatly about developing solutions that are both technically and aesthetically sound (You know what generator functions and HTML entities are and when/why to use them.) You bring your experience and perspective to conversations about the future growth of our applications and environment. You have a desire to surround yourself with talented peers who share your dedication. In short, you write solid, thoroughly tested, and readable code, and are ready to contribute as part of a highly effective team.

In an intermediate engineering role, you will immediately begin to add value to a complex application that clients depend on to get their jobs done. You will learn to refine not only your own code but the Crunch APIs that this application is built upon. Your responsibilities will grow to include ownership of new features, the resolution of bugs, and regression-proofing both through comprehensive test coverage. In any given week, you might:

* work on new features with other frontend team members
* triage, unravel, test, and resolve bugs and issues - we use Sentry for automated issues tracking and UserSnap for user reports
* update existing code in parallel with backend changes to ensure uninterrupted operation
* review your colleagues' work on GitHub Pull Requests
* propose, discuss and debate technology improvements, code organisation, design patterns, and conventions employed in the front-end development environment

Front-end developers on our platform are first-class team members. Although your focus is primarily on JavaScript, you will gain familiarity with the entire system. Some of the technologies that enable us to achieve our well-designed, efficient, and performant applications are:

* ECMAScript (latest specification, as needed)
* Babelify
* Webpack
* React + Redux
* Immutable data objects
* AngularJS 1
* Stylus

If you have experience or interest in these additional areas, you may have the opportunity to work with them as part of your role:

* End-to-end testing (we use Nightwatch.js and Docker)
* Mobile design / touch interfaces

### Qualifications:

* A firm command of JavaScript and, more importantly, an appetite for continual improvement and growth
* Familiarity with JavaScript frameworks and libraries for building web applications, such as Angular and React
* Commitment to high development standards, including comprehensive testing in whatever language youâ€™re working; e.g. in JavaScript, this would be Jest, Jasmine, Mocha, ...
* Demonstrated ability to work with team of peers, understanding and respecting the responsibilities and expertise that developers, designers, QA folks, and others bring to the project
* Ability to provide reasonable estimates on work, meet deadlines, and take ownership and responsibility
* Well-developed principles of self-motivation and time management
