**Reports to**: VP Software Engineering

**Work location**: North America, 100% remote

**Direct reports**: 6 to 10 software engineers

We are hiring a Software Delivery Manager to help expand our platform and operations excellence, someone who has been a software engineer and has grown into a project manager and team manager role. We invite you to join our small, fully remote team of developers and operators, helping make our platform faster, more secure, and more reliable. You will be self-motivated and disciplined in order to work with our fully distributed team.

We are looking for someone who is a quick study, who is eager to learn and grow with us, and who has experience in Agile cultures. At Crunch, we believe in learning together: we recognize that we don’t have all the answers, and we try to ask each other the right questions. As Crunch employees are completely distributed, it’s crucial that you can work well independently and keep yourself motivated and focused.

# Our stack

We currently run our in-house production Python code against Redis, MongoDB, and ElasticSearch services. We proxy API requests through NGINX, load balance with ELBs, and deploy our React web application to AWS CloudFront CDN. Our current CI/CD process is built around GitHub, Jenkins, and Cypress.io, including unit, integration, end-to-end tests, and automated system deployments. We deploy to Auto Scaling Groups using Ansible and Cloud-Init.

- Keep track of project dependencies and critical paths.
- Assign programming tasks to developers and follow up to completion.
- Ensure that team members have appropriate product and technical specifications, direction, and resources to deliver products effectively.
- Establish realistic estimates for timelines and ensure that project remains on target to meet deadlines.
- Lead daily scrum meetings with developers to discuss project progress and quickly resolve any blockers.
- Help developers resolve both technical problems and human resources issues.
- Create visual burn-down of team deliverables and status.
- Coordinate with Crunch's Cloud Operations team to efficiently deploy new software.
- Demonstrate leadership in the deployment of software upgrades, enhancements, and fixes coordinated based on release schedules.
- Provide frequent status reporting to all company leaders and project stakeholders. Compile and report software development KPIs.
- Monitor and evaluate individual employee performance and conduct formal, bi-annual performance reviews.
- Participate in evaluating, hiring, on-boarding, training, and mentoring new employees.
- Provide leadership and guidance to coach, motivate, and lead team members to performance targets and career development.
