**11. Will there be any changes to how I manage my KnowledgeHound account or billing information?**

For now, you can manage your account as you currently do, with Crunch now being the entity for billing. New Bank account information for ACH payments and invoice address changes are available via your KnowledgeHound team and/or will be provided upon contract renewals.
