Researchers create a <strong>Crunchbox</strong> with a few clicks. Choose the data and dimensions to be included. Then deliver a <strong>CrunchBox</strong> inside a <strong>CrunchBoard</strong> dashboard or in any website of your choosing. Add annotations and verbage to outline your insight to the customer. Include multiple <strong>Crunchboxes</strong> covering different topics or content.
