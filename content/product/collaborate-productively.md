Deliver survey data and analytics to your company and customers â€” controlling who sees what and what they can do with it. Researchers can work on the data visually, creating crosstabs, charts, filters, analyses, complete decks, and fine-grained tab books, all without programming or ever having to worry about fragile data files. At the same time, data scientists can use the powerful Crunch API to dig deeper using R or Python.
