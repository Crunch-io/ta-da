### Crunch web application

- Enabled users with ‘Editor’ permissions to add, modify, and remove a PowerPoint template on a folder. Previously, only account admins had permission to manage a PPT template.
- Removed the ability to directly share datasets that are created in personal folders.
- **Fixed the following**:
    - Filter footnotes were not displaying on dashboard tiles.
    - Multitable rendering sometimes failed when a filter was either applied or removed.
    - Deselecting the ‘Display Empty rows/columns’ option was not working when viewing numeric-array variable summary cards.
    - Selecting the ‘Show values’ option was not rendering the values on line-graph dashboard tiles.
    - Integration-update issues occurred (including [Decipher](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040119051-How-to-import-from-Decipher-into-Crunch) and [Confirmit](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060784772-How-to-import-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch)) when the source dataset had missing or duplicate variable titles, which then led to aliases that were missing or duplicated.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the [DEFINE HOMEPAGE](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/16329096980109-DEFINE-HOMEPAGE-command) command (folder scripts), which allows you to add a homepage to a folder.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Added new content that describes [how to sort tables and graphs](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360039306152-Tables-and-charts-with-drag-and-drop#toc4), where certain answers can now remain fixed to the end of tables and graphs when sorting. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/fix-categories-when-sorting/) for more information.
