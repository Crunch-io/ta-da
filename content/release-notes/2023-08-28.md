### Crunch web application

- Updated the design of the [Dataset Properties](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040059632-Dataset-Properties) menu — it now includes many dataset actions that are available directly from the dataset menu. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/updated-dataset-properties/) for more information.

**Fixed the following:**

- Opening the rich-text editor to create a new rich-text tile would sometimes display an image from a previous rich-text tile editing session.
- A variable could not be dragged directly from the sidebar onto an existing variable within the filter builder in order to create a parentheses group.
- For pairwise-comparison hypothesis testing, an incorrect cell shading was sometimes applied in crosstabs with a numeric array in the row dimension and hidden empty rows/columns.
- The selection of group filters for a dashboard was not working correctly when working with variable summary-card tiles.
- Deck exports for sum and percentage share of sum-numeric array analyses were not working correctly.
- After switching a dataset from weighted to unweighted, tables with a base column would sometimes still render weighted values in that column.

### Crunch Automation

- [REVOKE](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/11309360322829-REVOKE-Permissions-command) folder command — added the ability to remove access to *all* datasets and projects inside the given path.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Made significant updates to the [Dataset Properties](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040059632-General-Dataset-Properties) help article to describe the recent updates made to various Crunch web app panel pages. See the list of [recently updated dataset-properties articles](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040059632#dataset-properties-articles) for more information.
