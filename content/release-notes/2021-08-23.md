### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue in which confidence bands were not displaying on time plots.
- Improved the positioning of horizontal axis labels when exporting PowerPoint graphs.

### Crunch Automation

- Created [DROP VARIABLES](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407236789901-DROP-VARIABLES-command), which is a new Crunch Automation schema command that allows you to drop multiple variables in a dataset.
- Fixed the [DISPLAY command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042038692-DISPLAY-command) so that it no longer overwrites other variable display attributes.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Added updated information about how to use [Crunch Automation schema commands](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041769292-Crunch-Automation-basics#toc1) when writing a script.
