### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue that occurred in Crunchboxes, where only unweighted values displayed instead of their weighted ones. They now display weighted values.
- Completed a change to ensure that Excel cells that contain text cannot be incorrectly evaluated by Excel as formulas.
- Completed all of the updates to ensure that deck dashboards respected a mix of weighted and unweighted tiles correctly.
- Fixed a bug that affected users that have permissions to datasets in more than a single account.
- Made additional technical refinements for integrating [Confirmit surveys](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060784772-How-to-import-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch) into Crunch.

### Crunch Automation

- The `COMPLETE_CASES` function no longer requires an array wrap around the arguments. For example,  `complete_cases([A, B, C])` can now be written as `complete_cases(A, B, C)`. See [Crunch Automation basics](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041769292-Crunch-Automation-basics#toc9) ARTICLE for more information.
- Added the [MATERIALIZE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/8472308632461-MATERIALIZE-command), which allows you to evaluate computed expressions  (such as case statements or recodes) and saves the values to the dataset.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created the following new articles:
    - [How to set up a partner SAML provider](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9284853041549-Setting-Up-a-Partner-SAML-Provider)
    - [How to delete a user through the web app](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9400918056333-Delete-a-user)
- Added new information on how to disallow all user access except for [one-time passwords](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045141591-Using-One-Time-Passwords).
