### Crunch app

- Refactor and performance enhancements to Search, making it easier for you to find things.
- Fix issue where dates could be shown incorrectly on project browser. We understand how frustrating it is when dates don't appear correctly so we fixed this.
- Search behavior has now been changed to only search when you press return. Focusing on the control will open any previously obtained results. This will make search queries easier to use.
- Fix improper results and behavior when using Target Group Base in Profiles mode. We think the new ordering of results will delight you!
