### Crunch web application

- **Fixed the following**:
    - A color assignment was sometimes incorrectly applied in PowerPoint exports when the categories for the analysis had been reordered.
    - The selection of a single column for pairwise-comparison hypothesis testing sometimes caused multiple columns to be shaded as reference columns.
- Added support for low base warnings and suppression for numeric array analyses.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the following new [folder script commands](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/10343332025101-Folder-commands):
    - [SET command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/13639703101709-SET-command) — allows you to change the value of a particular folder setting.
    - [REMOVE DIRECT SHARES command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/13640380422157-REMOVE-DIRECT-SHARES-command) — allows you to delete all of the existing direct shares from the indicated datasets.
    - [DEFINE VIEW command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/10521651144333-DEFINE-VIEW-command) — allows you to create views from datasets by indicating a selection of variables, variable folders, and a filter to use.
- Updated the following [dataset commands](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360010677071-Dataset-commands):
    - [CREATE/REPLACE TEXT CASE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/13551320541325-CREATE-TEXT-CASE-command) — new command that allows you to create your own text variable, within which you obtain values from multiple sources under different conditions (similar to the [CREATE NUMERIC CASE](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045656352-CREATE-NUMERIC-CASE-command) and [CREATE CATEGORICAL CASE](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042039192-CREATE-CATEGORICAL-CASE-command) commands).
    - [CREATE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042039512-CREATE-MULTIPLE-DICHOTOMY-FROM-command) — now requires you to create individual variables instead of accepting a multiple input in order to provide better control over the responses’ aliases. The previous version did not allow you to provide user-defined subvariable aliases for the newly created multiple response variables.
    - [OVERWRITE VALUES command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057819011-OVERWRITE-VALUES-command) — now replaces all rows in a dataset regardless of the applied exclusion filter.
