### Crunch web application

- Fixed the following issues:
    - Users with access from teams that are shared to parent projects would sometimes not display.
    - When exporting a tab book, it would sometimes fail when using certain setting combinations.
    - The ‘edit tile footer’ field would sometimes display an inconsistent response when typing values into it.
- Made performance improvements to [Confirmit integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360013455732-Confirmit).

### Crunch Automation

- Fixed the following issues:
    - The [CREATE TEXT CONCATENATE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/6354863541133-CREATE-TEXT-CONCATENATE-command) now works with categorical and text variables.
    - The [CREATE MULTIPLE SELECTION command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044079971-CREATE-MULTIPLE-SELECTION-command) now works when the input has multiple missing categories.
- Added the [CREATE CATEGORICAL CONSTANT command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/7191307304461-CREATE-CATEGORICAL-CONSTANT-command), which allows you to create a categorical variable with a single value.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a [new article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/6666901466509-Using-project-folders-in-Crunch) that describes how to use project folders in Crunch.
