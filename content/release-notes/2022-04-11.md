### Crunch web application

- [Folder Homepages](https://crunch.io/dev/features/folder-homepage/) is now available in wide release.
- Made the following PowerPoint export improvements:
    - Removed the “All” title from exports of univariate bar graphs.
    - Exports for a tabbed graph analysis now reflect the tab's name corresponding to the data on the slide.
- Fixed the following issues:
    - The search query was not working properly when a query contained an ampersand (`&`) character.
    - Graph categories were rendered with incorrect colors if certain categories were suppressed.
    - For numeric array timeplot analyses, the vertical axis would adjust incorrectly if there were negative values to plot.
    - The color assignment was sometimes assigned incorrectly for CrunchBoxes.

### Crunch Automation

- Fixed an issue in the [RECODE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042039012-CREATE-CATEGORICAL-RECODE-command) where duplicate category IDs are created under certain conditions.
