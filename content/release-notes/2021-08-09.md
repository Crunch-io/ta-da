### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue when hypothesis-testing shading was not being reflected in the 'Mean' row when a column was selected for comparison.
- Added support for ascending/descending sorting of the labels column.
- Fixed an Excel export issue that occurred when creating filters through the 'Filter by dropzone' that then resulted as an "on-the-fly" expression instead of the actual filter description.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when row labels could sometimes disappear when horizontal scrolling through a large bivariate analysis.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the [Stacking a dataset using R](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045887531-Stacking-a-dataset-using-R) article with new information.
