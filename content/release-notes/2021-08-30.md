### Crunch web application

- Updated data exports so that hidden multiple response subtotals are no longer included.
- Improved the 'Select Categories' panel for a time plot so that it now displays multiple response subtotals in the correct order.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a new article that describes [how to use a CSV + JSON metadata document](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407992870925-Setting-up-a-dataset-from-CSV-datafile-JSON-metadata-description-document) to automate the setup of a dataset.
- Organized the [Sharing Data](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360008205352-Sharing-Data) section to better describe how various types of users can easily share a dataset.
- Updated the [How to import from Decipher into Crunch](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040119051-How-to-import-from-Decipher-into-Crunch) article with new information about Decipher permissions and using the Crunch API.
