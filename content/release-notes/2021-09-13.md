### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue that occurred when a filter is created by dragging a variable from "My variables" to the filter zone so that it now works correctly.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when an unexpected format for the filter definition sometimes causes a dashboard tile to not load properly.

### API endpoints and API reference

- Updated the [folder endpoint](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/datasets/-dataset_id-/folders/script/) to obtain the variable organization script so that it now returns a `shoji:view` as default, but will return a plain text response if requested with the `Accept` HTTP header `text/plain`.
- Added [documentation](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#post-/datasets/-dataset_view_id-/view_preview/) about a new API endpoint that allows you to do a dependency check for proposed changes to dataset view definitions.

### Crunch Automation

- Fixed two bugs for the [RENAME command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042247331-RENAME-command) when working with arrays and their subvariables within the same script.
