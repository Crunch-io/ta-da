### Crunch web application

- Made performance improvements for rendering tables in dashboard tiles.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when double-clicking on a tile in dashboard view would sometimes not load the corresponding analysis in ‘tables & graphs’ view.
- Fixed an issue in which scorecard column headers could sometimes render overlapped (early access only).
- Added the ability to show subtotals and calculated differences on graphs, which is now in wide access. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/graphing-subtotals-and-differences/) for more information.
- Improved deck and tab-book exports so that they now reflect suppressed entries for the corresponding ‘Column t-test’ results for suppressed categories that are below minimum base size for a dataset.

### API endpoints and API reference

- Enabled [API Keys](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415963337869-API-Keys) for our [API](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/apikeys/-apikey_id-) users, who are encouraged to switch their practice from login (user token) to key. Crunch API libraries for [R](https://crunch.io/r/crunch/articles/crunch.html#authentication) and Python (see below) and their documentation have been updated accordingly.

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Updated [pyCrunch](https://github.com/Crunch-io/pycrunch#getting-started) and [sCrunch](https://github.com/Crunch-io/scrunch/wiki/User-Reference#connect-to-the-crunch-server) with new information on how to use API keys.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a new article about [Folder Homepages](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4424703021325-Folder-Homepages), which describes our latest features on how to organize your datasets and provide access management. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/folder-homepage/) for more information.
