### Crunch web application

- Fixed the following issues:
    - Slides were sometimes not appearing properly within a deck.
    - Some columns within a multitable were no longer visible after decreasing the browser page magnification.
    - Double-clicking on a tile in dashboard view did not switch to ‘tables & graphs’ view.
    - Changes made to the sorting order of a univariate analysis in the Edit > Categories panel were not able to be saved.

### Crunch integrations

- Made the following [Confirmit-integration](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060784772-How-to-import-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch) fixes:
    - Responses now load properly when the capitalization doesn't match the metadata.
    - Made improvements to the overall progress while pulling data from Confirmit.
    - Fixed a bug where Confirmit data expects a category not defined in the metadata by adding it instead at the response-parsing time.
    - Fixed a bug that occurred when a Confirmit integration created a categorical array of text variables that should *not* be nested in a categorical array.
- Made the following [Decipher-integration](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040119051-How-to-import-from-Decipher-into-Crunch) fixes:
    - Improved the handling of very large imports, which also optimizes the progress while pulling data from Decipher.
    - Improved the handling of dates in situations where Decipher provides an ambiguous date format.

### Developer documentation

- Updated numerous articles within the [Crunch help center](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360008315951-Start-Here) to reflect the latest instructions on how to use [API keys](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415963337869-API-Keys).
