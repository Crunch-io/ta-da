### Crunch web application

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Added the following enhancements to the [CrunchÂ package for R](https://crunch.io/r/crunch/):
    - make and edit markdown slides, including images.
    - create slides with more than one filter.
    - create subtotals on multiple response variables.
