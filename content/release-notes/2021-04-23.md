### Crunch web application

- Released the time plot feature to wide access, so that 'time periods' with no data at the beginning or end of a time range are now omitted from the horizontal axis â€” this is now dynamic as you add or remove categories. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/new-time-plots/) and [help documentation](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057226852-Time-series-analysis-with-time-plots) for more information.
- Fixed a bug that prevented datasets that are shared with users from appearing in search results.
- Improved how N values display on a time plot after selecting a categorical date entry on a group filter (in early access).
- Fixed an issue where hypothesis testing colors were displayed incorrectly after showing/hiding rows in edit mode.

### Crunch Automation

- Added ALTER ARRAY ADD EMPTY SUBVARIABLE command, which allows you to modify a non-derived array by adding new empty subvariables. See [documentation](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059806532-ALTER-ARRAY-ADD-EMPTY-SUBVARIABLE-command) for more information.
- Updated the [CREATE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM CONDITIONS command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360056799552-CREATE-MULTIPLE-DICHOTOMY-FROM-CONDITIONS-command) with improved instructions and use cases. It's now possible to use a single expression to define the base either by indicating the `VALID` or `MISSING` rows.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Added more functions that can be used with Crunch Automation scripts (`KEEP_AFTER`, `KEEP_BEFORE`, and `KEEP_BETWEEN`). See [documentation](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041769292#toc8) for more information.
