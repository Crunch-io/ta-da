### **Crunch web application**

Updated the UI for the variable folder tree:

- New search results by variable folder option. See the [AI-Powered Variable Search](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/33552869343117-AI-Powered-Variable-Search) helpdesk article to learn more (*early access*).
- More intuitive feedback form for search results.

Added support for AI-powered search to allow users to search for exact keywords only.  See the [AI-Powered Search in Crunch](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/40867072211469-AI-Powered-Search-in-Crunch) article to learn more. 

Added a new ***All*** tab to give users the ability to search for variables, datasets, and documents in the same place. See the [AI-Powered Search in Crunch](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/40867072211469-AI-Powered-Search-in-Crunch) helpdesk article to learn more. 

Introduced a more flexible way to create dashboards. See the [How to create a dashboard](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9414063249549-How-to-create-a-dashboard) helpdesk article to learn more (*now in wide access*).

- Viewers can now create dashboards on any dataset. Viewers can share dashboards with other users on dataset views. See the [Dataset Views](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405522348301-Dataset-Views) helpdesk article to learn more about views.
- All users can create private draft dashboards that are only visible to them until shared.

### **Crunch Automation**

- Added the [REORDER AXES command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/41678013893005-REORDER-AXES-command), which allows you to change the order of aliases within an array variable.

### **Lakehouse**

Lakehouse exports now support a new optional parameter `minimum_revision` , which ensures the export contains data from recent updates that may be still replicating across the system.

- [Export directly from a datasource or dataset](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#post-/datasources/export/)

Lakehouse exports now include public derived variables from the Crunch platform.

- [Export a datasource](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#post-/datasources/-datasource_id-/export_data)

Lakehouse datasets now support variable folders. Variable folder information may be included during ingestion or in exports, and an API is available to retrieve the variable folders for a dataset.

- [Get folders for a datasource version](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/datasources/-datasource_id-/folders/-version-/)
- [Organizing variables](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040060112-Organizing-Variables)
