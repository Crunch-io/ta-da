### **Crunch web application**

Enhanced search experience to make finding your data and documents faster and more intuitive. See the [AI-powered search](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/40867072211469-AI-Powered-Search-in-Crunch) helpdesk article to learn more:

- Introduced AI-powered search for smarter discovery.
- Updated search UI for improved usability.
- Added new document search functionality.
- Added Boolean search support to use AND, OR, & NOT operators.

Introduced a more flexible way to create dashboards. See the [How to create a dashboard](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9414063249549-How-to-create-a-dashboard) helpdesk article to learn more (*Early Access*).

- Viewers can now create dashboards on any dataset. Viewers can share dashboards with other users on dataset views. See the [Dataset Views](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405522348301-Dataset-Views) helpdesk article to learn more about views.
- All users can create private draft dashboards that are only visible to them until shared.

Added new functionality to allow viewers to share artifacts like dashboards, filters, variables and multitables in dataset views. See the [Shared artifacts in views](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044581851-Shared-artifacts-in-Views) helpdesk article to learn more. 

Implemented a fix to prevent an error message that previously appeared when users logged out and then logged back into Crunch. 

### **Lakehouse APIs**

- Added [a new Download API to Datasources](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/40974722113293-Exporting-Data-with-Crunch-Lakehouse-APIs) that allow small datasets (less than 50 million datapoints) to be downloaded in a single Parquet data file.

### **Backend/CrunchDB**

- Introduced a minimum score threshold for AI-powered search to reduce the number of less relevant search results.
- Removed all backend support for personal folders.

### **Developer documentation**

- Restructured Lakehouse API documentation to align with [ingestion and export use cases](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/33391375240205-Crunch-Lakehouse).
