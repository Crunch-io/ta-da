### Crunch web application

- **Fixed the following**:
    - Navigation between dashboard tabs was not working correctly.
    - Hidden columns became visible after performing a column sort on a dashboard tile.
- **Qualtrics [integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360013551691-Qualtrics):**
    - Fixed an issue where Qualtrics fields in a loop-and-merge integration were not sequential (i.e., the index in the list of fields did not correspond to the `id` of the CSV header).
    - Added support for “Authenticator” blocks that Qualtrics added to survey flows.

### API endpoints and API reference

- Added new API endpoints that allow you to [retrieve](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/users/-user_id-/preferences/) and [modify](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#patch-/users/-user_id-/preferences/) the preferences object for users.

### Crunch Automation

- Fixed an issue that occurred when executing a [CREATE FOLDER command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/10521631962381-CREATE-FOLDER-command) on the account level.
- Added new API instructions on how to run [account-level folder scripts](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/10521594535309-Getting-started-with-folder-scripts).

### Help desk and website improvements

- CORRECTION (*see updated link in the following*): Created a new article that describes [how to transition](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/14031750497677--Shared-with-me-folder-transitioning-to-folder-sharing) away from dataset sharing to folder-based sharing.
