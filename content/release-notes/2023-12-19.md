### Crunch web application

- **Made the following updates**:
    - The dashboard design now allows you to specify minimum and maximum widths for your dashboards, enabling a more consistent and visually appealing experience across various screen sizes. (in *early access*). See the [feature announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/min-max-width-dashboard/) for more information.
    - The KPI comparisons feature is now in wide access in production. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/kpi-comparisons/) and [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040045512-How-to-add-a-KPI-tile-to-a-dashboard) for more information.
- **Fixed the following**:
    - Base sizes are now displayed in the tooltips (previously showed zero) in a numeric array column or row percentage share of sum graph.

### Backend/CrunchDB

- Improved how CSV files are handled: if you provide a CSV file that is compressed using PKWare (type 9 format) for import, you will now receive and error message requesting you to compress in a different format since Crunch cannot uncompress this type.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a new [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/22051616032653-Setting-the-width-of-a-dashboard) that describes how to set the width of a dashboard.
