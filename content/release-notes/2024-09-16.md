### Crunch web application

- Improved the user experience when accessing data from more than one Crunch organization: if a user needs access to data from multiple organizations, they will need a separate user account for each organization and to sign in to an organization’s specific workspace to see their data. If you have access to Crunch from one organization, this will not impact your access to Crunch.
- Fixed a table misalignment issue that occurred when cell coloring appears across hidden “empty” columns.
- The new graph customizations have now been moved from early access to wide access in production. This feature provides more control over how your graphs are displayed in dashboards. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/new-graph-customizations/) and [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9414277417741-Customizing-dashboards-and-dashboard-tiles#h_01J3XVABPZWWMTWAJS4RZY23F8) for more information.
