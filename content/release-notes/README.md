# Release notes
From https://www.appcues.com/blog/release-notes-examples:

Like the old “if a tree falls in a forest” adage, if those improvements aren’t accompanied by effective product release notes, did they even happen?

Product release notes act as a direct line of communication with your loyal customers and power users. Used effectively, they open up a unique engagement channel with your users that keeps them excited about what’s coming next.

Sharing release notes on a regular basis also helps set the right expectations. They’re not only a great way to keep users informed, but also to retain frustrated users who might otherwise be kept in the dark about bug fixes or new features that they’ve been yearning for. Product release notes let users know that their feedback was not only heard, but that it was used to make meaningful changes.

## Best practices
* Keep product release notes brief
They’re product release notes not essays. You should only need a few sentences and bullet points to let users know what’s new.

* Avoid technical jargon
You’re not impressing anyone with release notes that require a PhD in computer science to interpret. Use plain language when describing updates.

* Help users explore new features
If you shipped a new feature, give a brief overview of what it does and where users can find it. Link to any blog posts, FAQs, or videos that your marketing team created to accompany the release.

* Write release notes like they matter
Because they do! Writing release notes with the expectation that people are going to ignore them if a self-fulfilling prophecy. Don’t be afraid to sound excited about all the cool things you shipped.

* It's okay to have the company's wit and personality shine through on release notes.

## Release notes vs. What's new vs. customer newsletters
Crunch has long published information about new features to customers - https://crunch.io/dev/features/ - which serves as the basis for the What's New link in our web application.

Crunch also takes selected new features and highlights them in our monthly customer newsletter.

What is different about release notes?

* Release notes can be more technical and are geared toward a more technical audience.
* Release notes can talk about functionality we are deprecating.
* Release notes can talk about about minor functionality changes that we are changing.
* Release notes can talk about bugs we have fixed.
* Release notes can talk about stability and performance improvements we have made.

### Technical debt

Crunch spends a lot of time paying down technical debt. Whether we port Angular to React, Python 2 code to Python 3 code, or change
a database from zz9 to mongo to redis, these are not typically things we would want in release notes. Release
notes should focus only on system changes that are directly visible to end users.
