### Crunch web application

- Fixed the following issues:
    - Certain messages were not sent to clients who have requested notification, specifically for dataset sharing.
    - Time plots using categorical dates with the date format `YYYY-Www` were not rendering properly.
    - Time plots would sometimes not save properly to the deck.
    - Scorecard creation would sometimes not work.
    - Vertical scrolling was not working properly for folders that have homepages defined for them.
- Updated the [Decipher](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360013455752-Decipher) variable format.
- Made a fix to how categorical arrays are exported to Excel (`.xlsx` ) files: since exports only print tables for the first 150 subvariables, users are advised to split larger arrays into chunks.
- Made improvements to the UI experience when exporting a tab book.
- Removed the option to import a multitable from the multitable builder.
- Updated the transformation for "multiple selections" operations to adapt to an earlier change in the handling of categorical arrays in order to reduce memory consumption.

### API endpoints and API reference

- Enforced [API Keys](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415963337869-API-Keys). Crunch is no longer allowing a username and password to access the Crunch API.

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Added information to [sCrunch docs](https://github.com/Crunch-io/scrunch/wiki/Scrunch-Reference#scrunchget_datasetdataset-sitenone-editorfalse) that describe support for using API keys.
- Updated rCrunch to explain how authenticating with crunch via `login()` is no longer supported. See [Crunch API Keys](https://crunch.io/r/crunch/reference/crunch-api-key.html) for more details on authenticating with API keys.
- Added experimental [rCrunch support for parquet exports](https://crunch.io/r/crunch/reference/exportDataset.html) in `exportDataset()`.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Added new information to the [Importing Decipher](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040119051#credentials) article, which describes how to obtain prerequisite credential information to load data from Decipher into Crunch.
- Created a new article for the new [Script Builder](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/5737523462669-The-Script-Builder-a-generator-for-Crunch-Automation), which describes how to use a customized Google Sheet that consolidates all of the key metadata from a dataset into one place. It acts as both a metadata reference and a tool for automatically generating [Crunch Automation](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041769292-Crunch-Automation-basics).
