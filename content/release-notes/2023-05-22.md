### Crunch web application

- Added folder location and 'Move to' functionality on the [Dataset properties](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040059632-General-Dataset-Properties) menu.
- **Fixed the following**:
    - The ‘Edit’ categories options for a saved-as-a-variable filter was not displaying all the variables in the definition.
    - Publishing a draft dataset was prevented in some cases when the subvariables of a multiple response or categorical array variable had been rearranged.
    - Recodes were not populating correctly within [Qualtrics integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360013551691-Qualtrics).

### Crunch Automation

- Added the ability to add exceptions and `VALID | MISSING` expressions to the [CREATE NUMERIC TALLY command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360049946672-CREATE-NUMERIC-TALLY-command).
- Added [DELETE DATASET](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/15191525378445-DELETE-DATASETS-command), which is a new folder command that allows you to delete multiple datasets under the current folder.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a new help article about how Crunch is [rolling out subdomains](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/15190286100877-Transitioning-to-subdomains-in-Crunch) in order to log into and see data within Crunch.
- Added a new help section on [how to share a folder with users from the dataset](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/10491415512461-New-permissions-framework-how-to-share-datasets-in-folders-with-members-in-your-organization#toc1) (folders & folder-based permissions).
- Updated the [General Dataset Properties](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040059632-General-Dataset-Properties) help article to include new information about how to use the new properties menu to view and move datasets into different folders.
