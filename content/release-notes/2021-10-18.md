### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue that occurred when sorting a bivariate table where the column variable had an intermediate category with N=0 followed by at least one category with N>0.
- Added a visual footnote to support the following features in the Crunch UI:
    - **within the export output** — the footnote reflects when standard errors of test statistics have been adjusted for overlap between columns of a multiple response variable.
    - **within in tables & graphs and multitable views** — the footnote reflects when standard errors of test statistics have been adjusted for overlap between columns of a multiple response variable.
- Added an [Export tab book](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040498732-Exporting-Tab-Books) option that allows you to write the entire tab book to a single table (*in early access*).

### Crunch Automation

- Added [RESET FOLDERS](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411258025485-RESET-FOLDERS-command), which is a schema command that allows you to reset all variables in a dataset to a given root folder (`ROOT`/ `SECURE` / `HIDDEN` ).
- Added the ability to use the `ALIASES` argument in the [CREATE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042039552-CREATE-MULTIPLE-DICHOTOMY-command), which allows you to indicate the aliases that each of the subvariables will have in the new dichotomy.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the [How to upload a PowerPoint template](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040054752-How-to-upload-a-PowerPoint-template) article to include more information on how to work with Slide Masters when creating a PowerPoint template.
