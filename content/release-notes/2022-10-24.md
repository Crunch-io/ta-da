### Crunch web application

- Added SAML SSO as an option for user authentication in Crunch. SAML is a secure, industry standard way for organizations to centrally manage users across applications. See the [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9284853041549-Setting-Up-a-Partner-SAML-Provider) for more information.
- Fixed the ability to edit the definition of logical variables (those created in the filter builder) when using the web app.
- Fixed table exports so that pairwise column tests between multiple-response columns (when some columns are hidden) now work properly.

### API endpoints and API reference

- Added new information to the [create account user](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#post-/account/users/) endpoint, which describes how account rules  will override the userâ€™s setting when adding the user in the API.
- Added  a new attribute (`path`) to the [folder endpoint](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/datasets/-dataset_id-/folders/-folder_id-/), which represents the folder location in the hierarchy tree.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created the following new articles to support the new dataset dashboard features:
    - [Dataset Homepages](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9571734333581-Dataset-Homepages)
    - [How to copy a dashboard from A to B](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9546301672461-How-to-copy-a-dashboard-from-A-to-B)
