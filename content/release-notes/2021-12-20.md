### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue that occurred with [Confirmit integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4403966631309-How-your-survey-metadata-maps-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch) that sometimes caused imports to fail for some datasets with certain configurations of numeric variables.
- Added the ability to omit categories from PowerPoint graph exports in situations where a base size is less than the configured minimum one, when the dataset has been configured for the ‘Suppress’ setting.

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Released new versions of `[pyCrunch](https://pypi.org/project/pycrunch/)` (v0.5.1) and `[sCrunch](https://pypi.org/project/scrunch/)` (v0.10.0), which include various features and performance improvements.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the [DISPLAY CLEAR command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416761638285-DISPLAY-CLEAR-command), which allows you to clear the subtotals created by the [DISPLAY](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042038692) subtotals command (removes all subtotals from a list of variables).
- Updated the list of [expression functions](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041769292-Crunch-Automation-basics#toc9) you can use with Crunch Automation commands.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a new help article about [how to use and manage API Keys](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415963337869-API-Keys).
- Created a new help article about [how to graph subtotals and differences](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416232124813-Graphing-Subtotals-and-Differences).
- Updated the [Tables, Graphs, and Maps](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040498472-Creating-Tables-Graphs-and-Maps) article with updated examples about the various display options that are available in the Crunch web app.
- Updated the [Confirmit integrat](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060784772-How-to-import-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch)ion article, which now provides detailed information on how to import our survey data from Confirmit into Crunch.
