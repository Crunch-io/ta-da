### Crunch web application

- Added the ability to specify minimum and maximum widths for dashboards (in wide access), enabling a more consistent and visually appealing experience across various screen sizes. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/min-max-width-dashboard/) and [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/22051616032653-Setting-the-width-of-a-dashboard) for more information.
- Improved the rendering of stacked bar and donut visualizations, which now use a new and improved method (using D3). Users may notice small changes to the layout.
- Added “Extend row labels” (default off) to the [Properties tab](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9414277417741#properties-tab), which makes a table use all the available horizontal space to better accommodate long labels.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the [REDEFINE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM CONDITIONS command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/23985586683917-REDEFINE-MULTIPLE-DICHOTOMY-FROM-CONDITIONS-command), which allows you to redefine a variable that was created using the [CREATE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM CONDITIONS](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360056799552-CREATE-MULTIPLE-DICHOTOMY-FROM-CONDITIONS-command) command.
- Updated the [CREATE FILTER command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042457091-CREATE-FILTER-command) so that it now supports a `COMPLETE CASES` modifier.
- Made the following performance improvements:
    - Decreased the time it takes to run large scripts.
    - System scripts that take longer to execute now show a progress bar and will no longer time out.
- Added additional help information about the various [types of scripts](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/22536937705613#ca-scripts) you can use with Crunch Automation.

### Backend/CrunchDB

- Updated the error messaging when using the `copy-from` operation: if it fails to copy artifacts from one dataset to another, it now properly marks it and provides a reason why it failed.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041300531-Editor-and-Viewer-permissions-on-a-dataset) that describes the various permissions that Editors and Viewers have on a given dataset.
- Added new and updated examples within the [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045984071-Recoding-case-level-missing-valid-values-rebasing) that describes how to recode case-level values to be valid or missing.
