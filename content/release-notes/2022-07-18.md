### Crunch web application

- Made the following improvements to tab book exports:
    - Fixed the error messaging that appears when something fails during the export of a tab book.
    - The `values` list within an exported tab book is now returned in the specified order for variables and subvariables. A bug previously prevented the order to output properly, which has been fixed.
- Improved [Confirmit integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360013455732-Confirmit) by enabling surveys that have image-based fields.
- Enabled numeric means so that they can be:
    - Rendered as a bar graph.
    - Exported to PowerPoint as a bar graph.
- Fixed the following:
    - The total population figure is now being pulled from the source view used for the `copy_from` function instead of the underlying dataset.
    - An error that prevented viewers from browsing outside of a folder that had a folder homepage has been fixed.
    - Edit functionality is now working for Profiles slides.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the [REORDER FOLDER command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/7680402433933-REORDER-FOLDER-command), which lets you change the order of the variables and subfolders inside a particular variable folder.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the [Definitive Guide](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044362492-The-Definitive-Guide-to-Importing-and-Preparing-Data) to importing and preparing Data with new information about various tools and resources.
- Added new information about:
    - How to use the [download structure](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045553112-Initial-organizing-of-variables-into-folders) link to download a Crunch Automation script that defines a folder structure.
    - How to [handle Google warning notifications](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/5737523462669-The-Script-Builder-a-generator-for-Crunch-Automation#toc2) when using the Google Sheets-based code generation tool.
