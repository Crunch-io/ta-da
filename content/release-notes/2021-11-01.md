### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue that occurred when anchoring a subtotal from the last category instead of the bottom position, which sometimes resulted in incorrect behavior in the web application.
- Fixed an issue in [Confirmit integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4403966631309-How-your-survey-metadata-maps-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch) that lead to some missing loop variables.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when 'Set comparison' was selected for one variable in a multitable definition that includes multiple variables: it instead shaded a column across *all* of the variables but only performed the 'Set comparison' for the first variable even if it was not the one targeted.
- Added the ability to [export tabulated data](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412334662157-Export-tabulated-data), which allows you to export tables (tab books) into a specialized output format (such as Tableau, Google Data Studio, or PowerBI). See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/export-tabulated-data/) for more details.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the ability to set subtotals and differences properties to be displayed for categorical variables in the [DISPLAY command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042038692-DISPLAY-command).

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the downloadable binary files to Version 2.2.1 in [The Quick Editor: a generator for Crunch Automation](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360054720992#toc3), which includes the following enhancements (as well as a few bug fixes):
    - Added the ability to create subtotals via the sub-variable tab
    - Added the ability to create share-of-total via the sub-variable tab
    - Dynamically remove embedded line feeds from variable titles and descriptions
    - Dynamically remove embedded line feeds from user inputs
    - Updated category subtotal commands to Crunch Automation's latest syntax
    - Added a checkbox to stop importing hidden variables in order to support large tracking datasets
