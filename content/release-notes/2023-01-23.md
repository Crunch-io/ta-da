### Crunch web application

- Fixed the following:
    - Incorrect cell colors sometimes appeared within three-way tables when switching tabs.
    - Users were not able to open ‘Edit categories’ for logical variables (such as those created via the filter builder).
    - The ‘Edit categories’ option was missing from the variable properties panel for a derived categorical.
    - Categories sometimes could not be renamed in the variable properties panel.
    - The full list of subvariables sometimes did not get displayed on numeric-array variable summary cards.
- Added the following:
    - The ability to allow the owner of a dataset to make a filter public even if they are not the current editor.
    - Support the export of images on dashboard tiles to PowerPoint.

### API endpoints and API reference

- Added three new endpoints that return the parents structure for special folders (Public, Secure, and Hidden):
    - [List public variables and subfolders](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/datasets/-dataset_id-/folders/public/)
    - [List hidden elements](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/datasets/-dataset_id-/folders/hidden/)
    - [List private variables](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/datasets/-dataset_id-/folders/secure/)
- Updated the docs for the [List public variables and subfolders](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/datasets/-dataset_id-/folders/public/) endpoint , which now describes its current behavior: it returns a catalog of folder trees but no longer the contents of the public variable folder.
- Modified the [List account and team users](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/users/) endpoint to allow users to search for accounts using an email address.
