### Crunch web application

- Fixed the following:
    - Materialization of formulas works properly now when a dataset exclusion filter is applied.
    - Users were sometimes not able to export a multitable that contains a formula weight, which has now been fixed.
    - Passing a variable through a function signature was triggering a type conversion when using the CSV importer, which has been fixed.
    - A bug occurred that prevented users from editing personal variables, which has also been fixed.

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Augmented the rCrunch package so that it now sends a `content-type` header when using `runCrunchAutomation` to avoid errors when assuming or guessing text or a JSON script.

### Crunch Automation

- Fixed a bug that prevented Crunch Automation scripts from creating sufficient project permissions.
- Added the following system-script (folder) commands (among [many others](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/10343332025101-Folder-commands)):
    - [MOVE FOLDERS command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/11309460023565-MOVE-FOLDERS-command)
    - [DELETE FOLDERS command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/11309694453901-DELETE-FOLDERS-command)

### Developer documentation

- Replaced the `deselect`function with `frame_subset`.
