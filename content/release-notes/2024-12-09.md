### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue where viewers of a dataset could not delete their personal variables.
- Added new functionality that allows you to upload, store, and deliver documents in Crunch folders. See the [new article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/30692709279245-Working-with-documents-and-media) and [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/documents/) that describes this functionality in more detail.

### API endpoints and API reference

- When creating datasets/views/forks, the `owner` in the request payload can be replaced with `project`.

### Crunch Automation

- Updated the way material variables work in Crunch Automation, which affects how the `MATERIAL` keyword is used in `CREATE...` commands. See the [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041769292-Writing-Crunch-Automation-declarations#toc12) for more information.
