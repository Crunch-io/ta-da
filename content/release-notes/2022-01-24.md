### Crunch web application

- Fixed an error that occurred in [SurveyMonkey integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360013455812-SurveyMonkey) when a “total” is not present in passed arguments.
- Added the ability to export datasets in the Parquet file format, which allows users to select categorical IDs to generate a more efficient Parquet file (the default export for categorical columns is column names).
- Added the ability to notify users when an invalid filter is applied as well as allow users to fix them.

### Crunch Automation

- Fixed an error in the [ALTER ARRAY command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045427871-ALTER-ARRAY-command) that occurred when attempting to add subvariables from another array, which now displays an error on validation.
