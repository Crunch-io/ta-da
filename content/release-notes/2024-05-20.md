### Crunch web application

- Mouse-hover responsiveness on Crunch graphs is now in wide access. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/graph-hover-behavior/) for more information.
- Enabled the ability to quickly export a copy of the current dashboard tile or on-screen visualization, which you can then share with others. See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/quick-copy/) and [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/26115363807117-Quick-Copy-to-image-or-clipboard) for more information.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when working with scorecards: the asterisk that enables the  display of hypothesis testing results is now rendering correctly in the display controller.

### Crunch Automation

- Adjusted the syntax when referring to subvariables: Crunch Automation scripts now return an error message if any command refers to the same subvariable code within different arrays without using the square bracket (`[]`) syntax.
- Made speed improvements when using the [CREATE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM CONDITIONS](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360056799552-CREATE-MULTIPLE-DICHOTOMY-FROM-CONDITIONS-command) command.
