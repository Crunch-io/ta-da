### Crunch web application

- **Fixed the following**:
    - It’s now possible to save to the dashboard tray when a table has a numeric array in the row position, a multiple response variable in the column position, and a column has been selected for pairwise-comparison hypothesis testing.
    - An `AND` condition can now be changed to `OR` in the filter builder.
    - Issues that occurred when applying or removing a filter in ‘dataset view’ have been fixed.
    - Dataset views now open when clicked from the folder browser..
- Correction to the [Release Notes 2023.08](https://crunch.io/release-notes/2023-06-26/), where it says ‘*Removed the ability to directly share datasets that are created in personal folders*’ — this should instead read as “**Stopped creating dataset shares for datasets created in personal folders**.”

### Crunch Automation

- Fixed [system scripts commands](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/10343332025101-Folder-commands) so that it’s now possible to refer to datasets when they share the same name within the same folder. The command refers to the dataset’s ID, using the `DATASET_ID()` function.
- An issue occurred where duplicated categories were created when using the [CREATE CATEORICAL CASE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042039192-CREATE-CATEGORICAL-CASE-command), which has now been fixed.
- Added a `DISAMBIGUATE` modifier to the [MOVE DATASET](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/10521646996237-MOVE-DATASET-command) and [MOVE FOLDERS](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/11309460023565-MOVE-FOLDERS-command) commands,  which allows you to rename moved objects in the destination folder to prevent naming conflicts.
- Enhanced the `SET MISSING` command so that it can now work on Multiple Response variables.
