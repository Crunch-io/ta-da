### **Crunch web application**

- Added Terms of Use for SOC2 Type II compliance. All users must log in to the Crunch UI to read and agree to the Terms of Use to continue using Crunch. Crunch has achieved SOC2 Type I compliance and is actively working towards SOC2 Type II compliance.
- Added the Expand dashboard tile feature to see dashboard tiles in full-screen view. See the [feature announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/expand-dashboard-tiles/) and [helpdesk article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/34267419053197-Viewing-a-dashboard#toc3) for more information.

### **API endpoints and API reference**

- All users who access the [Crunch API](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042695251-How-to-Use-the-Crunch-API) must log into the Crunch UI to read and accept the Terms of Use to continue using Crunch.

### **SDKs (rCrunch, pyCrunch, and sCrunch)**

- Fixed a bug that occurred when running `as.data.frame()` on a dataset with array variables with a single subvariable.
