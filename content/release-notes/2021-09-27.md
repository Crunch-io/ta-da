### Crunch web application

- Made the following color assignment corrections:
    - in deck analyses that include a multiple response variable with subtotals.
    - in a categorical variable that has subtotals/differences defined for it.
- Added an 'Insufficient Data' message on a tile, which appears when dashboard tiles have no results due to group filtering.
- Added the ability to drag tiles to a new location on the current dashboard tab by using only one drag-and-drop action.
- Added bar graph support in situations where the 'Show means' option has been selected for a univariate categorical variable in the 'Tables & graphs' view.
- Fixed an issue in which the view within 'Edit preview' was not responding to the change after sorting the direction for a sorted univariate analysis.

### Crunch Automation

- Added support to the [DROP VARIABLES command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407236789901-DROP-VARIABLES-command) to allow a larger number of variables.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a new article about [Numeric Arrays](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409897907981-Numeric-Arrays), which is a new variable type that enables you to work efficiently with groups of numeric variables that are related.
