## Crunch web application

- Fixed a bug on the Decipher importer to instead show a full list when importing.
- Fixed a bug so that dashboards appear properly when switching tabs.
- Fixed a bug so that dropdown menus for individual dashboard tiles work properly.
- Improved PowerPoint graph exports to correctly show expected colors for negative values.
- Enhanced how standard deviations appear in tab book exports so that they correctly show the row variable as a numeric measure.
- Improved how time plots reposition in the far-right location when the horizontal axis range changes (in early access).
- Fixed a bug that causes new connections to Qualtrics to fail.
- Improved how the time marker for a time plot appears when it moves to the left of its docked position â€” it now retains that position when also selecting a filter, applying a weight, or enabling/disabling confidence bands (in early access).
- Improved horizontal and vertical bar graphs so that negative values now display.
- Fixed dashboard URLs that specify filters to work properly when another filter is added.
