### Crunch web application

- Added functionality to prepend 'Loop Names' to loop variables, which makes them work better in the UI and prevents clashes between variables.
- Fixed a bug in the [Confirmit importer](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4403966631309-How-your-survey-metadata-maps-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch), which caused the variable name to be the same as the alias.
- Fixed a bug that caused integrated datasets to not have a working update dropdown.
- Made the following fixes and improvements:
    - Negative differences now display properly if the checkbox 'Empty rows/columns' in the display controller is deselected.
    - Displayed categories now correctly match the selected list of categories in dashboard time plots.
    - Pairwise comparisons now appear correctly for an analysis that has a multiple response variable in the column position (in cases where the multiple response variable included at least one subtotal).
    - The UI now works properly when 'Missing' categories are positioned anywhere outside of the bottom of the category list.
    - The anchoring of subtotals at the bottom of the list of categories now correctly renders the relevant variable summary card.
    - Tooltips above table cells now display the correct information.
    - The properties panel for a categorical array now displays correct information when one or more subtotals or differences were defined on the categories.
    - The 'Set comparison' hypothesis testing option is now available in cases where subvariables are in the column position.
