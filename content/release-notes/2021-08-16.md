### Crunch web application

- Changed how the N values are listed at the top of the marker bar in a time plot so that they always reflect the unweighted N value.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when time plots cannot be created in certain circumstances for a categorical variable with only one category.
- Added PowerPoint support so that 'Min' and 'Max' Y-axis settings are now reflected in graph exports.
- Updated population estimates for "at least N of" filters so that they are now consistent when "complete cases" is turned off for the filter.

### API Endpoints and API Reference

- Added a [/projects](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#patch-/projects/-project_id-/) path, which changes project settings and allows you to move datasets and sub-projects into it.
- Removed the `/datasets/{id}/folders/trash/` endpoint.

### Crunch Automation

- Unmaterialize materialized commands â€” went back to creating derived variables in automation `CREATE VARIABLE` commands.
