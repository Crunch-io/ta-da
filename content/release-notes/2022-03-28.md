### Crunch web application

- Fixed the following issues:
    - Rollup changes did not reflect on tables and graphs.
    - Filter footnotes did not display properly in graphs.
    - PowerPoint exports of graphs failed if one or more categories were suppressed.
    - The rendering of discrete values for a numeric variable did not appear in ‘tables & graphs’ view.
    - Image links in exported markdown files did not work.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the [Dataset Level User Access](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041300531-Dataset-Level-User-Access) help article to include clarifying information on Viewers, Editors, and Admins.
- Updated [Folder Homepages](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4424703021325-Folder-Homepages), which provides additional information on how to add video tiles.
