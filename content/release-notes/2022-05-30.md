### Crunch web application

- Fixed the following in [Confirmit integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060784772-How-to-import-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch):
    - Errors occurred when non-numeric category IDs are used.
    - Surveys were not being displayed because they exist on subsequent pages.
- Fixed the following in the web ap:
    - The numeric scale for a CrunchBox could mismatch the selected measure.
    - Changes to the ‘Min’ and ‘Max’ value axis settings for a graph were not persisting.
- Enabled Dataset Views (*in early access*). See the [announcement](https://crunch.io/dev/features/dataset-views/) and [documentation](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405522348301-Dataset-Views) for more information.

### Crunch Automation

- Fixed an issue that occurred when using the [OVERWRITE VALUES command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057819011-OVERWRITE-VALUES-command) to overwrite numeric array subvariables.
- Added the [CREATE TEXT CONCATENATE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/6354863541133-CREATE-TEXT-CONCATENATE-command), which allows you to create a new text variable by concatenating multiple inputs by alias and using an optional separator.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a [new article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/6134285384205-Adding-an-API-key-in-the-browser) that describes how to add an API key in your browser.
