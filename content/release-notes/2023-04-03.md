### Crunch web application

- **Fixed the following**:
    - The summary row would not change from ‘Unweighted N’ to ‘Weighted N’ (or ‘Both’) when viewing in multitable view.
    - Performance was slow when loading certain multitables.
    - The rendering of numeric variables did not appear correctly when they have a valid count equal to zero.
- Variable names are now transformed into aliases when creating them though the Crunch web UI — the automatically-generated alias for the variable will no longer be an exact copy of the name of the variable. See the [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/13535334060301-Variable-name-aliases) for more information.

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Added the ability to run Crunch Automation scripts on project folders.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the [DROP EMPTY FOLDERS command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/14055262411021-DROP-EMPTY-FOLDERS-command), which allows you to delete all empty folders in a dataset.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created a new article that describes [how to transition away from dataset sharing](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/14055262411021-DROP-EMPTY-FOLDERS-command) to folder-based sharing.
