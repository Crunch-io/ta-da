### **Crunch web application**

Made a change to the dataset edit experience. The previous “edit mode” (unlocked icon) became schema edit mode. Changes include: 

- When an editor unlocks a dataset (becomes the current editor), they will enter schema edit mode.
- In schema edit mode, editors can continue to update the dataset schema, build public variables in the UI and run Crunch Automation Scripts.
- In schema edit mode, access to personal variables (”My Variables” folder) is disabled (grayed out). To view personal variables, the editor will need to lock the dataset. To promote a personal variable to a public variable, the dataset must also be locked first.

Added a fix to prevent Crunch logo from showing before branded logo.  

Updates to Crunch UI: 

- Added header to folders and moved menu to new headers.
- Moved folder filters from a drop-down menu to be tabs.
- Removed the menu option to create new folders, datasets, and documents and replaced it with a more visible **New** button on the top right corner of folders.
- Replaced the legacy permissions icons with a new, more visible **Permissions** button on the top right corner of folders.
- Added a new button to toggle between datasets and dashboards.
- Refreshed dashboard tab appearance (Early Access).
