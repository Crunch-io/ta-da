### Crunch web application

- Updated the [Manage Users](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/20214383713165-Managing-a-user-in-the-Manage-users-panel) panel in Crunch, including a cleaner layout, displaying the dates the user was added and last authenticated, and adding the ability to configure users as clients or organization users.
- Made significant enhancements to the [Bar Plots in Crunch](https://crunch.io/dev/features/new-bar-plots/), including a cleaner layout, more readable text, and a new confidence interval display. See the [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/20500101668365-Confidence-intervals-on-graphs) for more information.
- Changed the label for the ‘Edit value’ button to "Edit KPI value”.
    - In cases where the user had already established a KPI + comparison value in an earlier session, the Properties panel then reflects the comparison cell selection.
- Improved the assignment of the maximum range in the value axis when exporting a PowerPoint stacked bar graph.
- Enabled data streaming for numeric arrays.
- Disallowed the ability to create a view with personal variables.
- Fixed the following:
    - A table layout would sometimes render with extraneous line wrapping when selecting the "Empty rows/columns" option in the display controller.
    - Editing a tile for a time plot was not correctly persisting customizations to the Min and Max ranges or hiding the Title and Subtitle.
    - Tables with many rows would sometimes only display a few. Now, all the rows are displayed (unless hidden).

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Updated `scrunch` to version version 0.16.0. See the [official page](https://pypi.org/project/scrunch/) for more information.

### Crunch Automation

- Changed how variables are referred to in array. See the [help article](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041769292#toc4) for more information.

### Back-end/CrunchDB

- Variable folders specified when creating a dataset from metadata now allow periods, commas, and dollar signs (`.`, `,`, `$`).  Previously, these were replaced with URL-safe strings.  This replacement only occurred during the dataset creation process, as the characters are always allowed for variable folders in other circumstances.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the [getting started help page](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360056505351-Finding-your-starting-point) so that it now provides quick access to popular articles for new users to Crunch.
- Updated the [Workspaces in Crunch](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/15190286100877-Workspaces-in-Crunch) help article, which defines workspaces in Crunch and how to use the workspace selector to find your Crunch workspace if you’re not sure where to go.
- Added new help articles that show you how to use the Manage users panel to [add](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/20213533659405-Adding-a-user-in-the-Manage-users-panel), [manage](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/20213533659405-Adding-a-user-in-the-Manage-users-panel), or [delete/suspend](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/9400918056333--Deleting-or-suspending-a-user-in-the-Manage-users-panel) a user.
