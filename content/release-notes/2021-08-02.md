### Crunch web application

- Improved [Confirmit integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4403966631309-How-your-survey-metadata-maps-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch) by streamlining the types of files they can accept.
- Fixed issue in which 'sort by value' does not work properly if the display controller is set to display only subtotals.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the REPLACE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM command, which allows you to convert in place a categorical array into a multiple response variable. See [documentation](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4406071596301-REPLACE-MULTIPLE-DICHOTOMY-FROM-command) for more information.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when combining [CREATE CONVERT](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360047136371-CREATE-CONVERT-command) and [UNSET NUMERIC VALUE](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360049589551-UNSET-NUMERIC-VALUE-command) commands in the same script for the same variable.
