### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue that occurred when CrunchBoxes did not display weighted values when applicable.

### Crunch integrations

- Made numerous  [Confirmit-integration](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060784772-How-to-import-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch) fixes, including:
    - Improved how categories are handled.
    - Fixed HTML image-tag spacing issues.
    - Fixed how subvariables and variables are imported, as well as ensuring that multiple/duplicate subvariable aliases are handled correctly.
    - Corrected category IDs so that they are instead treated as integers (and not strings).
    - Made additional looping and parsing fixes to further optimize Confirmit integrations.

### Crunch Automation

- Updated the [CONVERT NUMERIC TO CATEGORICAL command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360047136371-CREATE-CONVERT-command) so that it now creates the output categories in a specified order.
- Implemented speed and performance improvements across all Crunch Automation commands when working with large datasets (with a lot of variables) as well as when viewing the the list of scripts on datasets that have multiple large scripts.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Added new uses cases to the [Recoding: case-level missing & valid values](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045984071-Recoding-case-level-missing-valid-values-rebasing-) ("rebasing") article.
- Created a new article that describes [how to share a folder](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/8778243127565-Folder-sharing).
