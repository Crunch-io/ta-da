### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue that prevented the "Set comparison" button for hypothesis testing of tables from working properly when the option to show only categories is selected.
- Added the ability to include subtotals to multiple response variables (in early access for editors).
- Added export support for numeric array variable summary cards that are saved to a deck, in use cases when a weight has been applied to a dataset.
- Made the following fixes:
    - a multitable consisting of categorical variables now loads properly.
    - a multitable consisting of a multiple response variable now loads properly when the row variable was a numeric.
    - differences now display in the 'Edit' preview for a categorical array analysis.
    - "hides" are now working for the columns variable in the 'Edit Categories' tab.
- Added more support for both Confirmit and Decipher integrations (see help desk articles below for more information).
- Removed the faulty value in the intersection between the weighted/unweighted 'rows and mean' column.
- Fixed the "x" and "remove all" buttons in the 'dashboard groups' panel.
- Fixed rare behavior that causes some export settings to fail.

### Crunch Automation

- Made more speed improvements to the [UNSET NUMERIC VALUE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360049589551-UNSET-NUMERIC-VALUE-command) when using numerous variables.
- Added support to the [CHANGE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042038132-CHANGE-command) (`LABELS`)  so that it can use functions alongside the explicit list of labels.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the [chart](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360061204751-Crunch-importers-overview) in the Crunch importers overview article.
- Updated the [Nets on a multiple response variable](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045631232-Nets-on-a-multiple-response-variable) article with new information.
