### Crunch web application

- Fixed an error that disabled the ability for [Confirmit-integrated datasets](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060784772-How-to-import-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch) to be updated.

### API endpoints and API reference

- Added a new field to the [View Filter Details endpoint](https://crunch.io/api/reference/#get-/datasets/-dataset_id-/filters/-filter_id-/applied/) (`definition`), which is a ZCL expression that represents the filter at the time it was created or last modified.

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Made further updates and improvements to the latest versions of [pyCrunch](https://pypi.org/project/pycrunch/) (v0.5.1) and [sCrunch](https://pypi.org/project/scrunch/) (v0.10.0).

### Crunch Automation

- Added a new optional argument (`INCLUDE MISSING`) to the [CREATE MULTIPLE SELECTION command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044079971-CREATE-MULTIPLE-SELECTION-command), which allows you to mark all-missing rows as valid.
- Fixed an error that prevented certain datasets to execute scripts.

### Help desk and website improvements

- Updated the [Stacking a dataset using R](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360045887531-Stacking-a-dataset-using-R) article with new scripting information.
