### Crunch web application

- Fixed the following in [Confirmit integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360060784772-How-to-import-from-Confirmit-into-Crunch):
    - A bug that occurred within surveys that define predefined lists *within* predefined lists.
    - Confirmit titles with empty strings (`""`) are now given a default title (`"No Title‚Äù`).
    - A category mapping is now used to fix column aliases when a grid variable is a categorical array.
    - Numeric arrays are now handled properly when there is missing data due to broken labeling.
- Fixed the size limit for response data on [Decipher integrations](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/360013455752-Decipher).
- Substantially increased the limit that can be used in subtotals of multiple-response variables. There was previously a de facto limit on the number of items, which rendered them unusable.
- Reenabled expression filters (i.e., filters that are not named) so that they appear in the footer of dashboard tiles.

### API endpoints and API reference

- Added a full `path` field, which is now returned whenever project entities are queried.

### SDKs (`rCrunch`, `pyCrunch`, and `sCrunch`)

- Updated the `R` package for `R-devel` changes to `POSIXlt` object comparison.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the [REPLACE NUMERIC CASE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/10343513945869-REPLACE-NUMERIC-CASE-command), which allows you to overwrite a non-derived variable's values with numbers based on multiple cases (conditions).

### Help desk and website improvements

- Added the following:
    - New documentation for [folder commands](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/sections/10343332025101-Folder-commands), which allow you to use scripts to automate Crunch.io operations outside of datasets.
    - New and updated articles to support scriptable dashboard workflows. See the [complete list of scriptable dashboard articles](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/10749608598157-Scriptable-Dashboard-articles) for more information.
