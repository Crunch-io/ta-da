### Crunch web application

- Fixed an issue that prevented all categories in the column position to be viewed when scrolling horizontally.
- Fixed an issue in which scorecard column headers would sometimes render on top of each other.
- Adjusted the limit on the number of tabs in a tab book (multitable) export to 500.
- Improved the user experience when viewing a time plot so that the top five categories displayed by default are now updated accordingly if the measure is changed in the display controller.
- Added the ability for a [CrunchBox](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040114352-Creating-a-CrunchBox) to now show empty categories.

### Crunch Automation

- Added the ability to use a `DATE` option (using ISO8601 format) on each category when creating variables in the following commands:
    - [CREATE CONVERT command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360047136371-CREATE-CONVERT-command)
    - [REPLACE CONVERT command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042247191-REPLACE-CONVERT-command)
    - [CREATE CATEGORICAL CASE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042039192-CREATE-CATEGORICAL-CASE-command)
    - [CREAT CATEGORICAL CUT command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042458431-CREATE-CATEGORICAL-CUT-command)
    - [CREATE CATEGORICAL RECODE command](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360042039012-CREATE-CATEGORICAL-RECODE-command)

### Help desk and website improvements

- Created the new [Dataset Views](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405522348301-Dataset-Views) help article, which describes how (and why) to use the Crunch UI to create partial dataset views to share with a client or colleague.
- Added up-to-date information about how to use Crunch Automation with certain tasks in the [Setting up a dataset with R](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040032911-Setting-up-a-dataset-with-R) help article.
