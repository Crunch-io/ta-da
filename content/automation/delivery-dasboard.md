### Use Crunch Automation to create or replicate a custom dashboard for:
* the same dataset
* A different dataset
* A subset of a dataset, “Dataset View”

### You now have the flexibility and power to choose to:

* Build an initial dashboard with drag-and-drop. Then, automatically generate, save, and apply a Crunch Automation script to quickly replicate a dashboard.
* Build a dashboard from scratch using only Crunch Automation
* Replicate a dashboard or tiles (analyses) using only Crunch Automation
