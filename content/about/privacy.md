### Last Updated: May 31st, 2020

Protecting your privacy is very important to us at Crunch Cloud Analytics LLC (“Crunch”, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”), and we use our privacy and cookies notice to explain our practices regarding our collection and use of information that we receive through the online analytic services provided at [www.crunch.io](http://www.crunch.io), and other related websites designated by Crunch (“Services”). This privacy and cookies notice applies to only those websites, services and applications included within our Services where this privacy notice is posted, and does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.

## What this notice covers

Crunch is responsible for collecting and using data in a responsible and safe way, and that starts with clearly telling you how we collect, use and protect your personal data.  This privacy and cookies notice sets out:

* What kind of personal data we may collect from you;
* How and why we collect and use your personal data;
* Why we may share personal data with other organisations; and
* The rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data.

We’ve tried to make our privacy and cookies notice as easy to read as possible, but if anything in here is unclear, please contact us at info@crunch.io, and we’ll be happy to clear it up.

### Legal grounds for processing your personal data

We do not envisage that any decisions that will have a legal or other significant effect on you will be taken about you using purely automated means, however we will update this notice if this position changes and notify you of those changes.

We are committed to the lawful, fair and transparent use of personal data.  In processing personal data for the purposes of providing our customers with our products and services, we process your personal data on the grounds that our processing is necessary for legitimate interests we pursue as a business, namely that our business relies entirely on the ability to use your personal data to provide our Services.

If we send you marketing communications to tell you about our products and services, we rely on one of the following legal grounds for processing:

* Legitimate interests; or
* Consent

Because marketing rules vary between countries, the legal ground for processing that we rely on will depend on your geographic location.

If you have any questions about the grounds under which we process your personal data, or would like to find out more about the approach we take to determine that these grounds apply, please contact us using the contact details in the ‘How to contact us’ section.

### Transferring personal data outside the EEA

Our servers are located in Ireland, so if you are based in Europe or the UK your data will remain in Europe.  If you are located outside of Europe, your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

## How we store and protect your personal data

We know how important it is to protect your personal data while we have it. This section describes some of the measures we take to ensure that it is kept secure.

We do everything we can to protect your personal data from loss or misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  This section describes some of the measures we take to ensure that your personal data is secure:

* We use data centres that have a high level of physical security measures to host and protect your data and our systems;
* We conduct independent penetration tests on a periodic basis and are continuously scanning our systems and applications for vulnerabilities in our systems; if you ever think that you have found a security issue or vulnerability in one of our systems please let us know at systems@crunch.io;
* We use encryption to secure your personal data whilst it is in transit using TLS;
* We allow access to attributable data (by which we mean data that directly identifies you) only to those Crunch employees who need it to carry out their job responsibilities, for example our account management team to allow them to respond to you when you contact us;
* We make security the responsibility of all our employees and we train our staff to identify security risks and protect your data.

Our website may from time to time contain links to and from other websites.  If you follow a link to any of those websites, please note that those websites ought to have their own privacy notices and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those websites.  Please check those privacy notices before you submit your information to those websites.

## Emails and notifications

This section explains the choices you have when it comes to emails and notifications we may send to you.

If you are a Crunch customer, it is important that we are able to send you emails and notifications about your use of our Services. For example, we may contact you about your account, billing or the terms governing your access to or use of our Services.  We may also contact you about other services that we offer, and for these messages, we rely on our legitimate interest in running our business as the legal grounds for this processing.

If you are a prospective client, we would like to send you marketing communications to tell you about our products and services, which could include information about industry insights, our Services and emails direct from our sales teams.  Because marketing rules vary between countries, the legal ground for processing that we rely on will depend on your geographic location, however you will always be able to unsubscribe (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive).
