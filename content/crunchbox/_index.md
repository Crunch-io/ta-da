A Crunch customer asked us to develop a lightweight, even easier, version of Crunch for one of their clients, who doesn’t live, breath and eat surveys all day.

So, we created the CrunchBox: the easiest and quickest way for anyone, with zero training, to slice and dice survey data.

<ul>
    <li>Don’t deliver all of the data in PowerPoint. </li>
    <li>Don’t repeat the same 30 slides for China, the US and UK.</li>
    <li>Deliver Crunch.</li>
</ul>

Instead of scouring through 100 slides to find the answer to a question, which might not even be there, get your answer in two clicks.
