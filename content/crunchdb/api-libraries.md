We have developed, and are always adding to, our R (RCrunch) and Python(PyCrunch) libraries, which perform many advanced uploading, cleaning, and analytics functions. But you donâ€™t have to stop there, you can connect to Crunch and run any model you like, create bespoke visualizations, or even write your own packages. Crunch is a modern survey platform.  The sky is the limit.
