Crunch is more than a friendly web app. Data scientists and programmers can work with the same data in [R](/r/) and [Python](https://github.com/Crunch-io?utf8=✓&q=&type=source&language=python) naturally. Changes made in one enviroment are available everywhere, so insights can be shared instantly. No more copying files — never get out of sync.
