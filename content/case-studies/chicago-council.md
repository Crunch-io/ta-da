The Chicago Council on Global Affairs is an independent, nonpartisan organization that provides insight into global issues and policy.

<span class="highlight"><span class="font-italic">The Chicago Council Survey team</span>, part of the Lester Crown Center on US Foreign Policy, uses Crunch.io to <span class="font-italic">analyze data from its annual survey</span> on American public opinion and US foreign policy.</span>

They have appended over 45 years of public opinion datasets into one dataset, previously only available in separate files, to enable simple and intuitive analysis of historical data.
