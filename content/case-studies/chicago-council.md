The Chicago Council on Global Affairs is an independent, nonpartisan organization that provides insight on global issues and policy.

The organization uses Crunch.io to analyze data from its biannual survey on major foreign policy issues of the day. <span class="highlight">They have <span class="font-italic">appended</span> over 20 years of public opinion datasets into one dataset, previously only available in separate files, to enable simple and intuitive analysis of historical data.

To share the insights, The Chicago Council on Global Affairs delivers CrunchBoxes â€” lightweight versions of their Crunch.io datasets so that people with no training can easily explore the data. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs also embeds interactive Crunchboxes into their website and social posts.
