The Chicago Council on Global Affairs is an independent, nonpartisan organization that provides insight into global issues and policy.

<span class="highlight"><span class="font-italic">The Chicago Council Survey team</span>, part of the Lester Crown Center on US Foreign Policy, uses Crunch.io to <span class="font-italic">analyze data from its annual survey</span> on American public opinion and US foreign policy.</span>

They have appended over 45 years of public opinion datasets into one dataset, previously only available in separate files, to enable simple and intuitive analysis of historical data.

    <p>Crunch.io has cut our data processing time down <span>immensely</span>.</p>
    <p>Longitudinal data analysis that used to take us hours now only takes us a <span>matter of minutes</span>, and can be done on any computer anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>This allows us to spend more of our time <span>analyzing and writing up the results</span> rather than looking at individual data sets. That's <span>gold</span> for our survey research team.
