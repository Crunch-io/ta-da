Gojek is the leading on-demand multi-service app platform and digital payment technology group in Southeast Asia. The company uses a call center to connect consumers to courier delivery and ride-hailing services. As of mid-2019, Gojek was a “Decacorn” valued at over $10 billion dollars with over 3,000 employees.

<span class="highlight">Gojek uses Crunch as a centralized <span class="font-italic">single-source-of-truth</span> repository for <span class="font-italic">data</span> collected from multiple market research companies</span> as well as from DIY surveys conducted in-house. The company values Crunch.io’s ease of use for large scale surveys. Gojek uses Crunch.io to analyze multiple tracker waves of data across a dozen countries.

Gojek has used Crunch.io to analyze fielded survey data to verify its completeness and accuracy, quickly identifying data that needs to be cleaned, to ensure more accurate insights.
