MetrixLab is a global research agency active in over 90 countries with half of the world’s top 100 brands as its clients. With Crunch.io, MetrixLab enables its clients to explore and engage with the data and survey results in real-time.

One of MetrixLab’s clients - a well-recognized, global fast-food franchise - used Crunch.io while conducting a taste test survey. Analysts were able to gather insights in real-time, segment individuals for additional questions based on immediate analysis of survey responses, and form additional focus groups to gain further insights.
