MetrixLab is a global research agency active in over 90 countries with half of the world’s top 100 brands as its clients. With Crunch.io, MetrixLab enables its clients to explore and engage with the data and survey results in real-time.

<span class="highlight">MetrixLab worked with Crunch.io to implement <span class="font-italic">real-time integration</span> between MetrixLab’s fielding software and Crunch.io.</span> One of MetrixLab’s clients - a well-recognized, global fast-food franchise - used Crunch.io while conducting a taste test survey.  Analysts were able to gather insights in real-time to immediately segment individuals and form focus groups for additional questions to gain further insights.

MetrixLab continues to grow as the one of the top three fastest growing market research agencies in the UK (2019) and demo Crunch.io to win new business.
