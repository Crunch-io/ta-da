## What are Dataset Folders?

Dataset folders allow datasets to be organized into folders in a similar manner to a file system such as Windows Explorer or MacOS Finder. Folders make finding, organizing, and sharing data more intuitive:

* Folders can be used to organize large collections of datasets into more manageable units. If your organization imports data from many sources or has a large archive of previously imported data, now you can organize the datasets by source, time of import/survey, subject, etc.

* Editors can grant access to different folders to different sets of users. Multiple clients (or multiple groups or teams within a client) can be granted access to just the data you want to show them, and furthermore, you can move a dataset into a folder to instantly make it available to all users who have access to that folder.

Here are some key differences from the old interface.

### Navigating
#### 1. Project icons have been replaced by folders

Folders can be sorted by clicking the column headers at the top of the list.

Note that while we have removed the custom project icons from prominence in the interface for now, we will be reintroducing them along with additional branding settings in the future.

#### 2. The new Shared With Me folder

Previously, any datasets that were shared with you, as well as any datasets that you had imported yourself, were stored together in the Personal Project project. Now you may see either or both of two folders, **Personal** and **Shared with Me** pinned to the top of the folders in **All Datasets**.  

**Personal** will only appear to users who have permission to import data. It contains any datasets you have imported and not moved to another folder.

**Shared with Me** contains datasets that have been shared with you directly without access being granted to the folder that contains it. If no datasets have been shared with you, this folder will be hidden.

If you have access to the folder that contains the dataset, it will appear in that location.

As always, when youâ€™re not sure where to find a dataset we recommend using the search bar at the top of screen. Our search allows you to filter e.g. just dataset names.

#### 3. The header shows your current folder and how you got there

At the top of the screen, the header now shows which folder you are currently in and the path to that folder. To jump back to a higher folder, just click on it.

### Organizing
If you are a data owner you now have new abilities to create folders and move datasets between folders. See http://support.crunch.io/articles/ceXXoAEi/Organizing-Datasets-Early-Access for more information on these features.
