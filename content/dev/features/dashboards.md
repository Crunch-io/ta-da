## What are Crunch dashboards?

A dashboard is a special view of your data that has been prepared with pre-made analyses — tables and graphs — designed to highlight key points for instant insight. Dashboards are great for conveying key information, drawn from your data, for users who don’t have the time (or the inclination) to do their own analysis. Crunch dashboards allow you to combine your important findings into a single display, perfect for sharing with colleagues and other end users. And best of all, in Crunch it’s really quick and easy to make them.

Here is an example of the kinds of dashboards you can create in minutes using Crunch...

## Didn’t Crunch already have dashboards?

It did, but they’ve received a really major upgrade and now offer much more functionality and flexibility, enabling you to create the dashboards of your dreams (assuming you’re like us and find yourself dreaming about data visualizations).

## So what’s new?

Here are some highlights from this latest release…

* Dashboard tiles can be repositioned by drag and drop.

* Dashboard tiles can be tall, short, wide, narrow, square, rectangular — just drag them into the shape you want them to be

* You can hide categories you don’t want to show (e.g. None of these, Don’t know)

* You can re-order categories however you like

* You can rename categories (great for those long labels)

* You can choose specific colors for chart bars / segments

* There are new graph types — donut and horizontal bars (including stacked bars) — which are also now available in Tables and Graphs mode

* The titles and subtitles for each dashboard tile are editable, allowing you to create a narrative for your data, a bit like the heading of a PowerPoint slide

* Dashboards can be given custom names, and those names appear as part of the URL, making them easier to identify in browser history and bookmarks etc.

* You can choose whether to make the dashboard the landing page of the dataset

Most of this should be nice and intuitive and just work, but if you get stuck there’s documentation you can find [here](http://support.crunch.io/articles/ckEAdgji/How-to-Configure-a-Dataset-Dashboard).
