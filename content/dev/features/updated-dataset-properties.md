Now dataset editors can access most dataset actions directly from the dataset menu. Additionally, we’ve redesigned our dataset properties page.

**New dataset menu**

When you click the dataset name from within a dataset, you may notice some changes to the dropdown menu:

{{<figure src="https://player-crunch-io.s3.amazonaws.com/help-crunch-io/screenshots/ds-properties-august-2023-01.png" width=600 class="img-fluid">}}

Many of the actions that used to be accessed through **Dataset properties** can now be performed directly from this menu. Specifically Export dataset, Append, Join, Organize variables, Exclude cases, and (under **Advanced**), Create draft and View dataset history. The interface for these actions has largely remained unchanged - only the way you select them has changed.

**Updated dataset properties panel for editors**

The other change we’ve made is to make the dataset properties panel nicer looking and more expandable.

The properties are largely unchanged, but they are now in a panel with two expandable sections. The **General** tab contains the options that were already in the dataset properties page, while **View permissions** contain options that were previously in the **Permissions** tab of the legacy dataset properties page.

These changes bring dataset properties more in-line with other parts of the application and should make working with the dataset easier for editors.

Viewers will see a read-only version of properties similar to the legacy **About this dataset** panel.

For full details of this new feature and where to find it, see the [help center](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040059632-Dataset-Properties).
