By using the new options panel revealed by clicking the three-dots icon in the display controller, users can choose which of these figures to display in the tooltip for table cells. The default statistics shown are the margin of error and unweighted base. Your chosen cell details are persisted as a user preference. For margin of error, you can also specify the number of decimal places you want to see.

The margin of error is also an optional cell value for both for tab books and for custom exports from the deck.

:bulb: Bases are currently only shown for column percentages.

For full details of all of the options available, see the [help center](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040932251-Customizing-a-Table-or-Graph#more-options).
