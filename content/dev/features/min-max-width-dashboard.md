We're excited to announce an update that brings added control to your dashboard designs. Our new feature allows you to specify minimum and maximum widths for your dashboards, enabling a more consistent and visually appealing experience across various screen sizes.

This update is a direct response to your feedback. Many of you have expressed the need for more control over how your dashboards appear to end-users, and we listened.

By specifying the minimum and maximum dashboard size to be the same value, you can create a fixed-width dashboard, ensuring that your view of the dashboard when designing it will be exactly the same as your users’ view when consuming it.

When creating a new dashboard, you’ll now have the option to choose between “Auto” and “Constrained”. Auto remains the default, where Crunch will dynamically resize the dashboard to maximize the use of the user’s screen, but if you want to prioritize a guaranteed layout over maximum use of space, you’ll want to switch to “Constrained” and specify min and max dashboard widths (in pixels).

Alternatively, by giving different values for the min and max, you can set your own bounds for how big or small your dashboard can be.

Even better, these controls are now also available for **existing** dashboards, allowing you to apply constrained or fixed sizing to dashboards you’ve already delivered.

## Try It Out Today

This new constrained and fixed width dashboards setting is available now on all Crunch scriptable dashboards. To use it, go to the “New dashboard…” panel for creating a new dashboard or go to dashboard Properties for an existing dashboard.

For full details of this new feature and where to find it, see the [help center](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/22051616032653-Setting-the-width-of-a-dashboard).
