Welcome to the next generation of search in Crunch. Our new variable search gives you more from your data by enabling quick and accurate retrieval of relevant insights with a simplified search UI.

Search your data using natural language rather than simple keywords – type the way you would normally talk and the search will find relevant variables throughout your data.

## How does it work?

Open any dataset to see the AI-search field above the list of variables in the left sidebar. Simply enter your search criteria and press Enter to find a sorted list of relevant search results. Click or drag & drop a variable in the search results to analyze the data in Crunch.
