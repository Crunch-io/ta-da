You’ll find that Crunch graphs now respond to hovering your mouse over the lines, bars and segments. The hovered part will retain full opacity while the other lines, bars or segments will fade, making it easier to clearly see the data of interest. This applies to:

- Single variable bar graphs
- Grouped bar graphs
- Stacked bar graphs
- Donut graphs
- Line graphs

You can also hover over the legend items to have Crunch highlight that ‘series’ or category. It can be particularly helpful for crowded line graphs, making the path of any individual line much clearer.

This new hover behavior applies to graphs in Tables & Graphs mode and on dashboards.
