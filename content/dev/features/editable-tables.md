You've already been able to customize saved *graphs*, but now you can make those same edits to the rows and columns of saved tables, either for export or for display in dashboards. More specifically, you can now...

1. Hide any rows and/or columns of a table, including calculated rows/columns such as subtotals, leaving only those you want your export/dashboard consumers to see. Simply uncheck the box next to the row/column to hide it.
2. Reorder the rows/columns of a table, just by dragging them into their new order.
3. Rename any row/column just by typing into the name box. Great for cases where the labels are too long or contain unwanted content.

Together, these allow you to turn this...

Into this...

All users can access this new functionality via the "edit" link shown upon hover of each slide saved to the deck, and editors can additionally access this functionality when editing dashboard tiles that contain tables.

Currently this feature is only available for early access users, though all users will be able to see any tables customized in this way.

See [the help site](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360041481052-Customizing-your-tables-for-export-or-dashboards) for more information on these features.
