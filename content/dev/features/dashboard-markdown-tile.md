Dataset editors can add markdown tiles to a dashboard that contains rich-formatted text. This can be used for dashboard analysis, terms and conditions, privacy notices, fieldwork dates and anything else the editor may wish to display. As an editor you are now able to:

* Compose text content to display as tiles using a WYSIWYG editor - no coding skills required.

* See a real-time preview of how your tile is going to look as you type and make formatting changes.

* Move, resize and delete text tiles.


See [our support documentation](provide link here) to get started.

We'd love your feedback at support@crunch.io.
