Dataset editors can now add rich-text tiles to a dashboard. This can be used for dashboard analysis, terms and conditions, privacy notices, fieldwork dates and anything else the editor may wish to display. As an editor you are now able to:

* Compose text content to display as tiles using a WYSIWYG editor - no coding skills required.

* See a real-time preview of how your tile is going to look as you type and make formatting changes.

* Alternatively, switch to markdown mode for greater control writing your own markdown syntax.

* Move, resize and delete rich-text tiles.


See [our support documentation](provide link here) to get started.
