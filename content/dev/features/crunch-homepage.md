## We’re excited to bring you a new home page in Crunch!

Your home page provides quick access to the most recent datasets and documents you opened in Crunch.

{{<figure src="https://player-crunch-io.s3.amazonaws.com/help-crunch-io/screenshots/crunch-homepage-01.png" width=700 class="img-fluid">}}

## How it works

Locate the dataset or document you recently accessed and click on the card. The recent activity will update as you open datasets or documents. You can click on the new Home icon at the top of the folder sidebar to return to the home page.

## Try it out today
