Folder Homepages can contain images, formatted text, and links to other resources to provide Crunch customization, as well as to aide in navigation to other resources such as terms and conditions. You can tailor the experience for your teammates and clients when they arrive into Crunch.

## Examples of usage

Expected use cases for these homepages include...

1. A welcome message for analysts accessing your data
2. An opportunity to add your branding and logos
3. Privacy notices and other terms & conditions, including external links
4. Guidance on how to navigate folders and sub-folders, including shortcutss to particular resources
5. Promotional text and/or images to other products and services that you offer (an opportunity for cross-selling) including links to further information
6. Hints and tips for using Crunch - "Did you know...?" - style feature reminders
7. Fieldwork information - perhaps talking about the periodicity of a tracker and when the next update is due
8. Who to reach out to for help and advice - main research contacts at your organization, perhaps including direct mailto: links
9. Instructions to *internal* users for how to manage the contents - dos and don'ts - as specified by DP departments for example

Folder Homepages are customizations of Crunch’s existing folder listings pages. A regular folder listing can become a Folder Homepage by the addition of one or more Rich-text tiles. When a Folder Homepage is added, the top area of the screen is made available for placing these tiles, and the regular folder listing will then appear directly below. Adding content to these Rich-text tiles, resizing them and laying them out is done via an Edit mode very similar to editing a dashboard. See the help page for this feature for full details.

For full details of this new feature and where to find it, see the [help center](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/4424703021325-Folder-Homepages).

Currently this feature is only available if you have enabled [Early access](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040465331-How-to-enable-early-access) in your application settings, though all users will see any Folder Homepages you create.

We’d love your feedback at [support@crunch.io](mailto:support@crunch.io).
