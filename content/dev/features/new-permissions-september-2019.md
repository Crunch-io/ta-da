We've made it much easier to view and change which of your users have access to your datasets and folders. If you are an editor on a dataset or folder, click the dataset or folder name in the header and select **Members** to open the permissions panel:

{{< figure src="dev/features/images/updated-members-panel.png" class="img-fluid bordered">}}

When viewing dataset members, this panel will show all users who have access to this dataset and what type of access they have, regardless of how that access was granted.

When viewing folder members, you will not only see everyone who has access to this folder, you will also see any users who have access to *anything* within this folder. Users who have access to some, but not all, folder contents (or who have non-uniform access) will show up as having **Mixed** access. You can change this to **Viewer** or **Editor** to grant that user uniform access to this folder and all its contents (including subfolders).
