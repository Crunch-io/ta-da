We’re introducing a more flexible way to create dashboards. Work in private drafts that give you space for experimentation before sharing with stakeholders, using our new draft and build feature. Whenever your new dashboard is ready, share instantly with stakeholders, on your terms.

## What’s new

* **Viewers can now create dashboards**, giving more users the ability to explore and visualize data.
* **All users can create private draft dashboards**, visible only to you while you work.
* **Draft dashboards can be published and shared** with teammates whenever you’re ready.\*
* **Share polished insights with confidence** once your dashboard is finalized.\*

## How does it work?

Open a dataset and click the deck/dashboard tray button:
