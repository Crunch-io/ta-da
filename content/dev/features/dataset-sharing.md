The sharing options for a dataset have been simplified and consolidated. Previously, both **Share** and **Members** links were visible to Dataset Editors. To simplify, Dataset Editors can only now see the **Members** link. The **Share** link option for Dataset Editors has been removed.

For Dataset Viewers, the sharing option with **Share** link has not changed.

Below we have outlined how you can share a dataset for different permission levels: Editors and Viewers.

# **Sharing a dataset for Dataset Editors**

To share a dataset with individual users or teams of users:

1.- Select **Members** in the Crunch web app:

# **Sharing a dataset for Dataset Viewers**

If you're a Dataset Editor, you may wish to enable Dataset Viewers to be able to share the dataset with others.

To enable this, go to **Dataset Properties > Permissions** and then check the **Share the dataset** box under '
Permissions for Viewers' as described in the following:

This enables a new menu option for dataset viewers:

In this view, Dataset Viewers can enter users with whom they want to share the dataset:
