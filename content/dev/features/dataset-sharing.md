Crunch now has one menu link for dataset viewers to share datasets and another menu link for dataset editors to share datasets.

Previously, both menu links were visible to dataset editors. To simplify, dataset viewers now only see the **share** link and dataset editors can only see the **members** link.

Below we have outlined how you can share a dataset for different permission levels: Editors and Viewers.

# **Sharing a dataset for Dataset Editors**

To share a dataset with individual users or teams of users:

1.- Select **Members** in the Crunch web app:

2.- Select the **Users** tab and then click **Add users**:

3.- Enter an email address and then click the **Invite** button:

# **Sharing a dataset for Dataset Viewers**

If you're a Dataset Editor, you may wish to enable Dataset Viewers to be able to share the dataset with others.

To enable this, go to **Dataset Properties > Permissions** and then check the **Share the dataset** box under 'Permissions for Viewers' as described in the following:

This enables a new menu option for dataset viewers:

In this view, Dataset Viewers can enter users with whom they want to share the dataset:
