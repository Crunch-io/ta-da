The sharing options for a dataset have been simplified and consolidated. Previously, both **share** and **members** links were
visible to dataset editors. To simplify, dataset editors can only now see the **members** link. The share link option for
dataset editors has been removed.

For dataset viewers, the sharing option with **share** link has not changed.

Below we have outlined how you can share a dataset for different permission levels: Editors and Viewers.

# **Sharing a dataset for Dataset Editors**

To share a dataset with individual users or teams of users:

1.- Select **Members** in the Crunch web app:

2.- Select the **Users** tab and then click **Add users**:

3.- Enter an email address and then click the **Invite** button:

# **Sharing a dataset for Dataset Viewers**

If you're a Dataset Editor, you may wish to enable Dataset Viewers to be able to share the dataset with others.

To enable this, go to **Dataset Properties > Permissions** and then check the **Share the dataset** box under '
Permissions for Viewers' as described in the following:

This enables a new menu option for dataset viewers:

In this view, Dataset Viewers can enter users with whom they want to share the dataset:
