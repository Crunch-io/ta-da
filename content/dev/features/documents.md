## We’re thrilled to introduce a powerful new feature to Crunch: the ability to upload and integrate documents alongside your datasets!

Now, you can provide comprehensive support for your research findings by adding relevant documentation directly to your projects. Whether it’s a detailed PDF or PowerPoint report, a questionnaire with crucial data points, a Word document with your analysis, or even images, you can easily enrich your insights and enhance collaboration with your team.

This feature empowers you to present a complete picture of your research, making it easier to share, review, and act on your findings. Enhance your reports, streamline collaboration, and elevate your analytical capabilities like never before!

## How it works

Navigate to a folder in Crunch, find New and select Documents in the folder menu, and upload one or more documents. Once uploaded, you can open the documents in Crunch. Users with permission to the folder will be able to see the documents.
