Numeric Arrays enable you to work efficiently with groups of numeric variables that are related. For example, you might have asked your respondents for the number of times they have engaged with each of a list of activities, or asked for how many times they've purchased each of a list of products, or asked for a numeric rating for how much they agree with a list of statements. In each case, the data collected consist of a set of numeric values. With Numeric Arrays, you now have a convenient way of combining these numeric variables into a single 'parent' variable. This is similar to the existing Categorical Arrays type which combine categorical variables into a single 'parent' variable for easy analysis.

Numeric Arrays appear in Variable Summaries mode like this...

The dot represents the mean value (x̄) while the extending lines (known as whiskers) show +/-1 standard deviation each side of the mean. Hovering over each point will show a tool-tip with the mean, the standard deviation, and the sample size for that variable.

In Tables and Graphs mode, Numeric Arrays can be displayed as tables, as bar graphs or as line graphs (when combined with a time-series variable). They can also be exported to PowerPoint or Excel as well as used in a dashboard.

As well as displaying means, Crunch can switch to showing two other measures - Sum and Percentage Share. You can read more about these in the documentation linked at the end of this page, where you will also find information on how to create Numeric Arrays and more.
