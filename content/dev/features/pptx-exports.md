We know that for many, PowerPoint slides remain central to delivering results and to paraphrase Mark Twain, "reports of PowerPoint's death have been greatly exagerated". Crunch has long offered exports of analyses and tab books to Excel files, which, in addition to their own value, enabled people to get results from Crunch to PowerPoint by copying a cell range from Excel into a slide. That’s a bit tedious, though, and we wanted to do better, which is why we are excited to announce that PowerPoint exports from Crunch are now available if you have [‘Early access’](http://support.crunch.io/crunch/crunch_user-display-settings.html#early-access) enabled in the app. We’re eager for feedback, so please try it and let us know how we can improve it to make it truly awesome for you.

Now you can download your Crunch decks of saved analyses directly to PowerPoint files. Each analysis shows up as a graph (or table) on a slide, and these graphs are fully customizable in PowerPoint so you can right click on them and access the underlying data. You can even apply your own style and template with just a few clicks. Here’s how:

<br />

## Download

To get a PowerPoint file, open the deck tray from the right edge of the [screen](http://support.crunch.io/crunch/crunch_saving-analyses.html) and from the dropdown select the deck you want to download. At the bottom of the tray, click the download button, which instead of just downloading an Excel file as before, gives you the option of Excel or PowerPoint. When you select one, the download starts.

## Customize in PowerPoint

When you open the deck in PowerPoint, you’ll see all of the analyses from your Crunch deck as slides. These are all fully editable: the charts in the slides are just as if you had made them yourself in PowerPoint, or pasted an Excel chart into PowerPoint. Turn your bar chart into a 3D pie chart, edit the legend placement, change the colors, anything you want.

You can even edit the data series behind the chart. For example, you may want to take slices of multiple charts and show them on the same slide. Each chart effectively has an Excel table embedded behind it, which you can alter as you need.

## Apply templates
From there, you can style it using a built-in or custom theme.

What’s more, because the graph is native PowerPoint, you can seamlessly incorporate your results from Crunch into your already carefully and consistently styled presentations; the graphs will take on the styles defined in your presentation. Simply drag, or copy and paste the whole slide or just the graph from the Crunch download into your deck.
