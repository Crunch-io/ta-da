Categorical Arrays are similar to the "grid" structures commonly used in market research surveys. Each row is actually a distinct question where they have a common set of answer categories, arranged as columns. The resultant grid-like structure of a Categorical Array allows you to easily compare lists of brands against a common set of attributes, or compare a set of statements against a common agreement scale - something that is much harder to do when those variables are separate.

Multiple-Response variables take this concept one stage further by having one (or more) of those answer category columns marked as "Selected" with the rest marked as "Other". This converts the Categorical Array grid structure into a binary Selected/Other which can then be displayed in a single-dimension 'flattened' form. This allows you to cross this variable by demographics or see it trended over time etc. A common use case for this is to build a "Top 2 box" version of the variable (or similar).

In both cases, the original variables used in the creation are unaffected, and you can use them in multiple simultaneous derivations.

The following videos demonstrate how to use these new builders. First to create a new Categorical Array from a group of single-response variables that have a common set of answer categories...

... and next to create a new Multiple-Response variable from a subset of existing categorical array sub-variables...

Note: Currently this feature is only available for early access users
