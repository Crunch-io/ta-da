## Export all on a single page

Multitables are a great way to quickly find key relationships in your data. Now it is easier than ever to take those insights away and build your data story with XLSX exports. Multitables can either be exported as a complete tab book, with a table of contents and multiple fields or measures for each table cell, or you can instantly grab an XLSX file of just what you see on screen.

It is also really convenient to get the data you see on screen — ‘this table’ — with the tab book settings and all the measures and customizations you can set and forget. Now, you can have both: set up your tab book preferences once by opening Export tab book > Customize. There you might want the count, percentage, and unweighted N of each cell — and cancel. Then choose “export this table (saved settings)” and those will apply to the instant Export this table result. Otherwise, Export this table will use the current display settings.
