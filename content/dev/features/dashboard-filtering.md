Dataset editors can add one or more variables to be used as filters across an entire dashboard with a simple drag-and-drop interface. This allows all dashboard viewers to get more out of your dashboards by customizing their view of the data. For example:

* Add demographic variables such as gender, age, education level, region, and ethnicity to allow your viewers to drill down on the customer populations that interest them.

* Add brands or products to create a dashboard that lets your viewers quickly understand the customer awareness, attitude, and usage of their products and competitors.

See [our support documentation](http://support.crunch.io/articles/ckEAdgji/How-to-apply-filters-to-a-dataset-dashboard) to get started.

This feature is currently in early access. We'd love your feedback at support@crunch.io.
