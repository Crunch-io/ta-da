Currently available just for our Early Access users, we'll be rolling this out to everyone soon.

Crunch now allows editors to add interactivity to their dashboards by applying filters. To get richer insights the editor can apply selected variables to display different analyses throughout a dashboard. Applying filters moves dashboards from static to a more actively engaging product for all users. Dashboard editors can now offer greater depth and create dashboards that are ready to interact with. See here for more details.

## How Dashboard Filters work

* As a dataset editor, you can set which filter variables are available to other users.

* As a dataset editor, you can apply filters to a dashboard that contains analyses that are already filtered. These will only accumulate.

* As a user without editing permissions you are able to filter an entire dashboard using filter options set by a dataset editor.

* For now, you can only filter a dashboard by clicking on one option per variable.

An example of how a dashboard looks like with filters applied is shown below.
