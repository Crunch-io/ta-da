Dashboard tiles can now be placed across multiple tabs, making it easier to navigate large dashboards. As an editor, you are now able to:

* Create new tabs (as many as you'd like)

* Move tiles from one tab to another

* Give tabs meaningful names to aid navigation

* Delete tabs, choosing whether to delete any tiles or move them to another tab

See [our support documentation](http://support.crunch.io/articles/co4jqnGi/How-to-add-tabs-to-a-dashboard) to get started.

Available now for our early access users. We'd love your feedback at support@crunch.io.
