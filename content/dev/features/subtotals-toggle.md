Today we're adding an interface enhancement that brings the existing functionality of toggling between subtotals, categories, or both in tables and graphs, right at your fingertips. Although not new, our user testing revealed that many users were unaware of this feature, and we believe this more visible placement will make it more obvious and easier to use.

You can now choose from these options via dedicated icons in the main Display Controller panel, making your data viewing and analysis more straightforward and intuitive.

Click on the desired icon to switch between "Subtotals only", "Categories only", or "Categories and subtotals".

This feature is currently available to [Early Access](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360040465331-How-to-enable-early-access) users.
