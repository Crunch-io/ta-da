It's been possible for some time to set custom colors for saved analyses in Crunch, but it's been necessary to do this on a one-by-one basis which can be laborious and open to inconsistency. We now offer the ability to create custom color palettes, defined at the organization level, at folder levels, or both, which apply your chosen colors to newly created analyses as well as offering alternatives (e.g. for scales) that can be applied easily, as needed for particular analyses.

If you are an **organization admin**, you can access the color palette create/edit controls via the **"Organization settings"** item in the 3-dots menu. Alternatively, folder editors can go to the folder menu (available by clicking on the folder name in the header when browsing datasets) and choosing **"Settings"**. Here you can set the default palette to use for all newly saved analyses as well as create new palettes and edit or delete existing ones.

The palette editor has a great real-time preview to show you how your color selections will look on a real Crunch graph.

Pro tip - if you create a palette with just one color in it, you can then set that palette for single-dimension analyses which will then use just that one color for all categories, which can often look more professional.

* **Note:** Only organization admins can create/edit/delete color palettes for organizations, and only folder editors can create/edit/delete palettes for individual folders. But those palettes will be available to all users within datasets in those organizations or folders.

To find out more about the new color palettes feature, you can read about it on our help page [here](https://help.crunch.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044813691-How-to-use-Color-Palettes-in-Crunch).

Currently this feature is only available for early access users, though all users will be able to see the colors assigned via the palettes feature.
