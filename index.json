While Crunch has always been at the forefront of providing survey analytics tools, we believe that data visualization can play a more prominent role in the research process. That’s why we\u0026rsquo;ve revamped our grouped bar plots to bring you an even more intuitive and insightful experience, bringing them in line with the enhancements already brought to univariate bar plots.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s New? Confidence Intervals: Make better-informed decisions by viewing the confidence intervals directly on the bar plots. This helps to immediately gauge the reliability of your data. See below for how to interpret these new displays. Cleaner Layout: Enjoy a more aesthetically pleasing layout that no longer tries to create huge bars that fill the whole area and instead focuses attention on the data. In particular, our horizontal bar plots make great use of the space and have smart handling for labels. Improved Text Readability: No more squinting or zooming in to read plot labels and data points. We’ve refined the text elements to make them easier to read at a glance. These changes will also affect existing visualizations saved to dashboards. In some cases, you may find that slightly more or fewer categories will be visible in a dashboard tile than before due to the new use of space.\nHow to interpret the confidence intervals Look at the Range: Each bar will have a black vertical line (the point estimate), which sits at the center of the 95% confidence interval. This range is where, given the data at hand, the actual value in the population is expected to fall in 19 out of 20 samples if the survey were repeated. Check for Overlap: If the confidence intervals of two bars overlap, it approximately means there’s not a statistically significant difference between the two groups or values you\u0026rsquo;re comparing. You can see this overlap happening between Brand A in Segment A and Brand A in Segment B in the example above. Note, though, that statistical best practice is to not treat this significance distinction as binary. The size of the intervals and the degree of overlap are relevant (don’t hold a ruler up to the screen; that defeats the purpose of showing the whole interval). Consider the Width: The width of the confidence interval (the total range of the plus-or-minus values) can tell you a lot. A narrower interval (±2%, for example) means you can be more confident in the accuracy of the survey result than if the interval is wider (±10%). How to Access the New Features The upgraded bar plots are now live and available to all users. Simply log in to your Crunch account and view or create any grouped bar plot. You\u0026rsquo;ll find the new bar plots are already enabled, ready to make your data storytelling even more compelling. Confidence intervals can be turned on using the same asterisk icon in the display controller that you already use for seeing hypothesis test colors on tables.\nExporting confidence interval graphs to PowerPoint When exporting a dashboard, graphs with confidence intervals enabled will use PowerPoint\u0026rsquo;s native \u0026ldquo;Error bars\u0026rdquo; functionality to represent the confidence interval range. They don\u0026rsquo;t look as nice as the Crunch ones but we want to ensure that exported visualizations remain editable, native objects, rather than static images. Exports from decks, for now, will not include the error bars. This will be addressed in a future product update.

Many of you have expressed the need for more control over how your dashboards appear to end-users, and we listened.\nBy specifying the minimum and maximum dashboard size to be the same value, you can create a fixed-width dashboard, ensuring that your view of the dashboard when designing it will be exactly the same as your users’ view when consuming it.\nWhen creating a new dashboard, you’ll now have the option to choose between “Auto” and “Constrained”.

We’ve added a tree view of the folders shared with you to the left side of the “all datasets” page, so you can browse and move more easily between subfolders.\nEditors and administrators can use the sidebar to organize folders and subfolders by dragging and dropping. Viewers can see the organization of any folder trees shared with them and navigate between different folders and subfolders they have access to.\nBenefits of Using Project Folders:\nTransparency. Administrators have complete visibility into who has access to which data. Everyone in a folder can see all the contents, on down through subfolders. To restrict access, you can create subfolders where only certain users and data reside. Scaling. Folders position your organization to grow in a manageable way. Organization. A strong system for organizing data and dashboards in a predictable place will facilitate discovery by others on your team. Curated delivery. Folder homepages let you give clients a custom landing page and give them a running start to dive into data. Ease. For ongoing projects, new datasets will no longer require explicit sharing — the new datasets added to the folder are accessible to everyone with access. Future enhancements. In future releases, dashboards, filters, variables, and other artifacts will be sharable at the folder level, taking collaboration to the next level.

Whether for an Omnibus product, a syndicated data product or simply different regional groupings, it can be challenging to meet the different data needs of these client and stakeholder groups with a single dataset. To meet this need, Crunch has developed Dataset Views.\nIn a nutshell:\nDataset Views contain a subset of variables and/or respondents from a dataset Dataset Views automatically update whenever the source dataset is updated You can give multiple stakeholders or clients access to the same dataset while ensuring that they only see the Dataset View specifically shared with them. This is particularly helpful for omnibus surveys, syndicated data, and segmented data, e.g., geography or industry.\nExamples of Use Cases\nRespondent (Row)-Restricted View: A dataset with responses from respondents from different countries, e.g., US and UK. It’s now possible to create two views so that one user group can only see responses from the US and another group can only see responses from the UK. Variable-Restricted View: A syndicated dataset with 20 questions covering entertainment and 20 covering travel. It’s now possible to create two views - one for entertainment questions and one for travel. An \u0026ldquo;Omnibus\u0026rdquo; style survey that contains questions belonging to multiple clients. It’s possible to give each client a View containing just the variables they have commissioned along with the demographics variables.

They\u0026rsquo;ve been popular features in tables and thanks to this latest release, they\u0026rsquo;re now available in graphs too. Both subtotals and differences can now be displayed in graphs in Tables \u0026amp; Graphs mode, as well as on dashboards and in PPTX exports, giving you the flexibility to display, save and report these summary statistics just like any other variable.\nGraphing subtotals Take as an example the following Region variable. An editor has created three subtotals for the different regions for a marketing strategy analysis. You can see them in bold at the top of this Variable Summaries card:\nPreviously, a graph of this variable would just show the categories, but now you can customize the display. By default, you will see both the subtotals and the categories displayed in a graph, like this:\nBut by triggering the additional Display Settings panel (via the three-dots icon), you can choose whether to show just Categories, just Subtotals, or both:\nThis would allow you to have a simpler graph of just the region subtotals, like this:\nLine graphs will allow you to choose from the categories and the subtotals via the existing \u0026ldquo;Edit\u0026rdquo; popup menu.\nGraphing calculated differences Displaying calculated differences on graphs works slightly differently to subtotals. Take as an example this categorical variable that has had a calculated difference added:\nThe \u0026ldquo;Net Meets expectations\u0026rdquo; value is the result of \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; exceeds my expectations\u0026rdquo; minus \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; falls well short of my expectations\u0026rdquo;.

This format contains a row for each cell of the table you see in the Crunch app. For example, this table from Crunch would generate 40 rows. There will be a row for the “All” category for “I am making more sustainable choices….” response, one for males and more sustainable choices, females and more sustainable choices, etc. all the way down to the 55+ age group and “Don’t know”.\nThe output format is a delimited text file of results that is ready to put into other analysis and presentation tools.

In each case, the data collected consist of a set of numeric values. With Numeric Arrays, you now have a convenient way of combining these numeric variables into a single \u0026lsquo;parent\u0026rsquo; variable. This is similar to the existing Categorical Arrays type which combine categorical variables into a single \u0026lsquo;parent\u0026rsquo; variable for easy analysis.\nNumeric Arrays appear in Variable Summaries mode like this\u0026hellip;\nThe dot represents the mean value (x̄) while the extending lines (known as whiskers) show +/-1 standard deviation each side of the mean.

There are many applications for subtotals on multiple response variables — a common one is a group of products or sub-brands within a brand, or a grouping of statements into themes. Previously, users had to define new variables with often complex logic to describe each combination, and then hide the input variable. Now, Crunch provides a way to specify combinations of items directly on multiple response variables. And even better, these subtotal categories will appear on graphs in Crunch, including on time-series graphs.\nThe method of creating multiple response variable subtotals is the same as the method for creating categorical variable subtotals.\nOpen the Properties panel for a variable and choose the new Subtotals button. In the screen that appears, click Create subtotal. Drag the categories that you want to combine into the dropzone and give the subtotal a name. Click save. You can then reposition the subtotal to somewhere other than the top if you wish. If you choose to position the subtotal at the top or the bottom then it will stay in this position, but if you move the subtotal to somewhere else in the list then this will attach it to the category immediately above it and the subtotal will then be kept immediately below that anchor category as the list is sorted. From this screen, you can also delete the subtotal or click edit to make changes to the subtotal’s definition or its name.\nOnce you’ve saved your subtotals, you will see them added in bold to the variable. Note that this is a change made to the original variable, and therefore will be visible to all users of the dataset.

Since then, we\u0026rsquo;ve worked to extend the new line graph functionality to those original Date/Time variables so that everyone can benefit from their better design and functionality, and we can now announce that all time plots will be using the new visualization.

That means that the sorted order will show in dashboards, including when you apply a filter, and in PowerPoint exports.\nSorting a table works as it always has - by clicking on the column header (once for descending, again for ascending and again to return to original variable order). Crunch will show a small chevron to indicate sort direction. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve sorted your table, simply switch to another visualization type to see that sort order reflected in the categories. The analysis will remain sorted in this way, even if you apply filters (i.e. the categories will change order, as applicable, to retain the largest-to-smallest sequence).\nSingle-dimension analyses (i.e. those that show just one variable) can also be sorted after they\u0026rsquo;ve been saved to the deck.

This is important to understand, because it informs you how you go about writing, running, editing and replicating datasets.\nWith SPSS syntax, it\ndirectly manipulates an SPSS datafile (eg: .sav file) is not designed with survey analysis in mind doesn’t set up derivations like Crunch does (it hard-codes anything you do as a new variable) doesn’t stay with the datafile (you keep your syntax separate from the datafile), and, importantly, alters your variables by overwriting the already-hard-coded variables with more syntax (which you can do endlessly) Crunch Automation is the opposite in these respects. It\nworks on data stored from any source (SPSS or whatever) is designed with survey analysis in mind (specifically with Crunch!) enables you to set up derived variables and artefacts (filters, multitables) - which are like calculations in the cloud stays with the dataset (inextricably linked to it) enables you to redefine the variable definitions in the first instance - so that you only declare variables once in the history The last point is important, because it affects how you make changes to a dataset, both in tracking and ad-hoc studies. Let’s explain by example:\nYou have 700 lines total of Crunch Automation to set up a dataset On line 80 you declare a derived variable (CREATE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM CONDITIONS) The dataset is in action, but you then realise you didn’t define the variable correctly. Or perhaps the research manager has * asked for an additional subvariable to be included. With SPSS, you would delete the variable and run-code again to redefine it. With Crunch Automation, the idea is that you go back to line 80 and fix the definition of the variable, and then re-run the script. So you Define-Undo-Redefine.\nWhat’s the advantage of the Crunch approach?\nWith SPSS syntax, you end up endlessly “mutating” your code history or the variable by writing additional lines of code. You might do things in a growing body of code in multiple places for the one variable… it becomes a tangle! You are not ever 100% certain if/when a particular script(s) was run or not on a datafile. The picture over time gets even more convoluted in trackers.\nWhereas in Crunch Automation, you should only ever need to change the definition of the variable ONCE around line 80. This is true in trackers where you just tweak line 80 on the next wave before append).\nPerhaps an analogy can help explain. If you’ve ever worked with Adobe Photoshop, you notice that you start with a source image, and then you add “adjustment layers” that manipulate the image into the final thing you’re after. That’s a bit like what Crunch Automation does - it takes your source material (data) and then builds it up into a fully fledged dataset (which is like the output image). If you want to make a change, you can undo the layers and fix a deeper layer, before reapplying the layers.\nThis is in contrast to SPSS syntax, where it’s a bit more like working in Windows default Paint program - you directly change the pixels and there’s no layering approach. In fact, there’s not really an undo function either - you’d need to make sure you had saved a version before any changes, and then hope your syntax log re-runs OK.\nCrunch Automation is a solid blueprint for your dataset\nCrunch Automation builds things up like a house - following the path of the Definitive Guide. The schema commands are like the concrete foundation (the first layer). Creating variables are like the structural pillars and the walls. Organizing variables (folde allocation) ensures everything is in the right room. Artefacts (multitables, filters, decks, dashboards) are like the soft furnishings - cushions, artworks, furniture. Once your house (schema) is complete, then people can come through the house (these are the respondents or cases in the data).\nIf you want to make a change to your house, the blueprint, you should unwind your house, make the change, and then build it up again. That way your house stays solid, simple and beautiful. The alternative (SPSS way) is fiddling with your house with endless renovations.

For example, surveys often ask respondents to use a common scale to rate or respond to different prompts, sometimes in a grid, all sharing a common set of response categories. When analyzing the data, a categorical array variable lets users see all the items together. This structure allows users to easily compare lists of brands against a common set of attributes, or compare a set of statements against a common agreement scale — something that is much harder to do with distinct categorical variables. Categorical arrays are displayed as two-dimensional tables or stacked graphs by default in Crunch, letting you compare the complete distribution between items.\nA multiple response variable is a kind of summary of the items or input variables in a categorical array. In its simplest form, responses take the form of either “selected” or “not selected”. Crunch uses this form (called “multiple dichotomies”) to represent survey questions where respondents can select multiple answers from a list of responses (“Choose all that apply”) — each response in the data is a separate variable, but for analysis, they need to be grouped together into a multiple response variable.\nMultiple response variables in Crunch allow you to choose more than one selected category, so you can also summarize an array of “level of agreement” into a multiple response view of the percentage who selected either “Agree” or “Strongly agree”. Multiple response variables are displayed as a ‘flattened’ form of a categorical array, allowing you to analyze this more condensed form, crossing it by demographics or trending over time, etc. These summary variables are sometimes called “top 2 boxes” referring to selecting the subtotal of the “top two” categories on a scale.\nThe following videos demonstrate how to create these new variables. First, we create a new array from a group of categorical variables that have a common set of answer categories.\nThen, we create a simplified multiple response variable from a subset of those items that we are interested in.\nFor more information see the help center.\nWe’d love your feedback at support@crunch.io.\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/dev/features/new-multiple-response-cat-array-builder/","tags":["analysis","multiple response","categorical array","variables"],"title":"Easily create and recombine categorical arrays and multiple response variables"},{"categories":["feature"],"contents":"It\u0026rsquo;s been possible for some time to set custom colors for saved analyses in Crunch, but it\u0026rsquo;s been necessary to do this on a one-by-one basis which can be laborious and open to inconsistency.

Personal now contains any datasets you have imported and not moved to another folder. Only users who have permission to import data will see the Personal folder. The other special folder, Shared with Me, contains datasets that have been shared with you without access being granted to the folder that contains it. If no datasets have been shared with you in this way, this folder won\u0026rsquo;t appear. The Personal and Shared with Me folders will be pinned to the top of the All Datasets list to allow them to be easily found and accessed.\nAs always, when you’re not sure where to find a dataset, use the search bar at the top of screen. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a specific dataset by name, you can narrow your search criteria to match only on dataset names.\nFor more details on navigating dataset folders, see the support page for more information.\nOrganizing If you have permission to import data in a folder, you can create folders within that folder, move datasets between folders, and grant other users access to folders.\nImporting data is now accomplished by clicking the dataset name and selecting New dataset.\nTo create a folder, click the dataset name and select New Folder from the dropdown.\nThis opens the New Folder dialog, where you can name the new folder.\nTo move a dataset or folder to a new folder, hover over it in the dataset list, click the down-arrow to open a dropdown, and select Move to\u0026hellip;.\nThis opens the Move to dialog that you can use to move the selected dataset or folder to any folder where you have write access (including your Personal folder).\nTo give other users access to a folder you have created, open that folder and then click its name in the header and select Members.

All of the folders now display correctly, including the very last one. Added a new homepage showing recent activity and quick links to helpdesk articles. The folder sidebar was updated with a link to the new homepage. See the feature announcement and help article for more information. Personal folders were migrated and are now regular folders in Crunch. The migrated folders show in the folder sidebar with all other folders and can now be shared with other users. Empty personal folders were removed and Personal folders will not be created automatically for new users going forward. Fixed how tabs are included in PowerPoint exports: previously, a PowerPoint export of a 3-way table of arrays would only include the first tab. The handling has been updated to include all of the tabs in the PowerPoint export. API endpoints and API reference When creating datasets/views/forks, the ownerin the request payload is no longer supported. Projectis now required and must be included. SDKs (rCrunch, pyCrunch, and sCrunch) There are two noteworthy API changes for users performing data processing tasks in Crunch:\n1. There is no longer a \u0026ldquo;Personal Project\u0026rdquo; to put datasets, which previously was the default place for creating datasets. This affects both creating/uploading new datasets, and making forks of existing ones.\nCreating datasets: The system won\u0026rsquo;t know where to put a new dataset unless you specify a folder or \u0026ldquo;project\u0026rdquo;. Going forward, rcrunch will by default error if you don\u0026rsquo;t specify a project (either by a string path newDataset(df, project = \u0026quot;/My Project/\u0026quot;), or a project newDataset(df, project = projects()[[\u0026quot;My Project\u0026quot;]])). There is also an option to add a path to the environment variable R_CRUNCH_DEFAULT_PROJECT (or option crunch.default.project) to use when no project is specified. Forking datasets: Previously, forks were created in your personal project by default, unless the project was specified by URL. Going forward, they will be created in the same folder as the source dataset unless you specify a project as mentioned above. Finding datasets by name: As a consequence, finding a dataset by name (e.g., loadDataset(\u0026quot;ds name\u0026quot;)) will no longer be useful, because it only finds datasets in your personal project or shared via \u0026ldquo;direct share\u0026rdquo;, which is also being deprecated. Instead, you must load datasets by ID/URL or with the path from a project. 2. Until further notice — The ability to convert a \u0026ldquo;derived\u0026rdquo; variable into a \u0026ldquo;materialized\u0026rdquo; one is soft deprecated (e.g., via is.derived(ds$var) \u0026lt;- FALSE). Rcrunch is preparing for this by changing these behaviors now:\nCreating variables: Because we\u0026rsquo;ve seen that it\u0026rsquo;s a common pattern to create a derived variable and then immediately convert it to materialized, it\u0026rsquo;s now possible to set an environment variable (R_CRUNCH_DEFAULT_DERIVED) or the option crunch.default.derived to FALSE so that newly created variables are materialized from the start. It\u0026rsquo;s also better documented in functions like VarDef and deriveArray that allow you to set the derive flag. Updating is.derived(): Will warn once per session that this is deprecated. You can install now via remotes::install_github(\u0026quot;Crunch-io/rcrunch\u0026quot;) or it should make its way to CRAN in in the coming 2–6 weeks, depending on other items for the longer CRAN release cycle. Crunch Automation Crunch Automation previously imposed a restriction on schema-breaking changes such as drop and rename, preventing common workflows such as variable deletion-and-re-creation. These restrictions have been relaxed, but users should exercise caution when making backward-incompatible changes that could render other variables or user artifacts invalid.

Unless otherwise defined in this SLA, capitalized terms used herein will have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement or Order Form.\n1.- Interpretation and Scope. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this SLA and those of the Agreement, the terms of this SLA will control. Matters covered under this SLA include the following:\n2.- Service Levels and Credits. At all times Supplier’s level of performance will be at least consistent with industry standards and meet the specific service and performance levels in this Schedule 100% of the time (“Service Levels”).\n1.- Should the Subscription Services in a given month of the Subscription Term not conform to the Service Levels specified in this SLA, Crunch shall issue Customer a service credit (“Service Credit”) in accordance with the schedule below, with the credit being calculated based on the fees for the month of the affected Subscription Services.\n2.- To receive a Service Credit, Customer shall submit a request to Crunch in writing/email. Each request shall include the following information: (a) Customer’s name and contact information; (b) date and beginning and end time(s) of missed Service Levels; (c) a brief description of the characteristics of the missed Service Levels; (d) and the amount of the Service Credit owed. Each Service Credit will be issued as a refund to Customer within thirty (30) days after Crunch’s receipt of Customer’s credit request.\n3.- Service Availability. The Subscription Service will be available at least 99.5% of the time each month, excusing only:\n1.- scheduled downtime occurring during any maintenance window. Crunch maintains a standing scheduled maintenance window from 0000 to 0800 UTC every weekday morning. Crunch may schedule additional Scheduled Downtimes outside of the standing scheduled maintenance window by providing an announcement on our status page (RSS feed available) at least 8 hours in advance.\n2.- any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Crunch’s reasonable control, including without limitation, criminal activity, acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems, Internet service provider failures or delays, or the unavailability or modification by third parties of third party offerings required to provide Subscription Services.\n3.- any unavailability in features that are pre-release, or are not otherwise generally available, including streaming datasets.\nThe service availability calculation will be measured on a calendar month basis, shall exclude Excused Downtime from the calculation, and shall be made by dividing the total number of minutes in a month in which the service was unavailable to more than 75% of users, by the total number of minutes in a month and converting the result to a percentage. If the Service Availability level for a given month should fall below the 99.5% threshold, then this shall be considered a Service Level Failure and the following Service Credits shall apply:\nService Availability Service Credit 98% - 99.5% [10%] of the fees for the month (1/12 of the annual SaaS price) during which the failure occurred 95% - 97.99% [20%] of the fees for the month (1/12 of the annual SaaS price) during which the failure occurred 94.99% and below [30%] of the fees for the month (1/12 of the annual SaaS price) during which the failure occurred 4.- Performance Standards.\n1.- Response Time. Crunch’s Project Management Team will respond to all Customer inquiries, issues, or complaints within two (2) business days. If Crunch fails to meet this performance metric three times within a 30-day period, then this shall be considered a Service Level Failure which shall initiate a Service Credit of [5%] of the fees for the month during which the failure occurred shall be owed to Customer.\n2.- Data Accuracy/Quality Issues. Crunch will notify Customer within two (2) days of the discovery of the incident and Crunch will keep the case active until resolution of the issue. If Crunch fails to meet this performance metric, then this shall be considered a Service Level Failure which shall initiate a Service Credit of [5%] of the fees for the month during which the failure occurred shall be owed to Customer.\n3.- Data Breaches Crunch will notify Customers within (3) business days of the discovery of data breaches.\n4.- Law Enforcement Crunch will comply with any legal subpoena for customer data and will notify the customer within (3) business days unless legally obligated not to.\n5.- Service Level Failures. Crunch acknowledges that its failure to meet one or more Service Levels shall have a material adverse effect on the business and operations of Customer. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary and without limiting Customer’s rights to receive Service Credits above or any other right or remedy which may be available hereunder, in the event\n1.- three (3) or more Service Level Failures occur during any consecutive 12 month period; or\n2.- if any single Service Level Failure persists for more than three business days\nthen, Customer may (reserving cumulatively all other remedies and rights under the Agreement and at law and in equity) immediately terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, upon notice to Crunch, without obligation or liability of any kind, and Customer shall be entitled to a pro rata portion of any annual SaaS fees paid to Crunch in advance.\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/about/service-level-agreement/","tags":null,"title":"Service Level Agreement (SLA)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Crunch web application Mouse-hover responsiveness on Crunch graphs is now in wide access.

Customer’s use of the Subscription Services includes the right to access all functionality available in the purchased Subscription Services as of the effective date of this Agreement or such other date expressly specified date in the Order Form. Unless otherwise determined by Crunch at its sole discretion, subsequent enhancements to the Subscription Services made generally available to all subscribing customers will be made available to Customer at no additional charge.

Unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, this Agreement will apply to any updates, upgrades and new modules or offerings subsequently provided by Crunch to Customer as part of any purchased Subscription Services.\n2. SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES\n2.1 Crunch Obligations; License Grant.\n2.1.1 Crunch shall comply with the Service Levels set out in the Order Form.\n2.1.2 Internal Use License to use Subscription Services. During the Subscription Term, Crunch hereby grants Customer’s employees, consultants, contractors, or agents who are authorized by Customer or its Affiliates to access and use the Subscription Services and who have been supplied user identifications and passwords by Customer for such purposes (“Internal Users”), a non-exclusive, revocable, limited internal use license to access and use the Subscription Services.\n2.1.3 Third-Party Use License to use Subscription Services.

Crunch will host the Subscription Services and may update the functionality and user interface of the Subscription Services from time to time in its sole discretion as part of its ongoing improvement of the Subscription Services. Unless otherwise agreed in writing and except as set forth in section 1.1, the Subscription Services shall be made available to the Customer as it makes generally commercially available to other Clients and may be subject to certain limitations, such as, for example, limits on storage capacity for Customer Data (as defined below).\n2.2 Use and Protection of Customer Data.

Customer understands that all Customer Data, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the Customer. By uploading Customer Data to Subscription Services, Customer aﬃrms that Customer is authorized to do so. This means that Customer, and not Crunch, is entirely responsible for all Customer Data that Customer and/or its Users uploads, downloads, posts, emails, transmits or otherwise makes available for use via the Subscription Services. Customer shall not, and shall ensure its Users shall not: (a) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit the Subscription Services or make the Subscription Services available to any third party, other than to Users or as otherwise authorized under this Agreement; (b) use the Subscription Services to collect, transmit or process any material that is infringing, obscene, threatening, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious, including material that is harmful to children or violates third party privacy rights; (c) use the Subscription Services to send, store, publish, post, upload or otherwise transmit any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, corrupted ﬁles or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any systems, data, personal information or property of another; (d) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Subscription Services; (e) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Subscription Services or its related systems or networks; (f) use or knowingly permit others to use any security testing tools in order to probe, scan or attempt to penetrate or ascertain the security of the Subscription Services; (g) access the Subscription Services for the purpose of building a similar or competitive product; or (h) copy, translate, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, disassemble, or decompile the Subscription Services or any part thereof or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or modify the Subscription Services.\n2.3.3 If during the Subscription Term the Customer undergoes a corporate restructure (including without limitation a change of control, merger or acquisition), which Crunch considers impacts the Agreement and/or the Subscription Services, Crunch may, at its sole discretion, suspend or terminate the access to the Subscription Services.\n2.4 Temporary Suspension. Crunch monitors all use of the Subscription Services for security and operational purposes. Crunch may suspend, temporarily, Customer’s or its Users’ access to the Subscription Services in the event that either Customer or its Users are engaged in, or Crunch in good faith suspects Customer or its User is engaged in, any unauthorized conduct (including any violation of this Agreement, any applicable law or third-party right, including the terms of any Third Party Offering on which Customer’s use of the Subscription Services relies). Crunch will use reasonable efforts to attempt to notify Customer prior to or contemporaneously with such suspension; provided, however, that Crunch’s exercise of the suspension rights herein shall not be conditioned upon Customer’s receipt of any notification. Customer agrees to: (a) notify Crunch immediately of any unauthorized use of any password or account or any other known or suspected breach of security related to the Subscription Services; (b) report to Crunch immediately, and use reasonable efforts to immediately stop, any copying or distribution of Customer Data that is known or suspected by Customer or its Users as being unlawful or unauthorized; and (c) not impersonate another User or provide false identity information to gain access to or use the Subscription Services. A suspension may take effect for Customer’s entire account, and Customer understands that such suspension would therefore include Affiliate and/or User accounts. Customer agrees that Crunch will not be liable to Customer or to any Affiliate or User or any other third party if Crunch exercises its suspension rights as permitted by this Section.\n2.5 Third Party Web Sites, Products and Services. The Subscription Services may rely on, or require, Customer accessing services provided by third parties (“Third Party Offerings”). Customer’s or its User’s use of Third Party Offerings must at all times comply with the applicable terms governing the same. Customer understands and agrees that the availability of the Subscription Services, or certain features and functions thereof, is dependent on the corresponding availability of Third Party Offerings or specific features and functions of Third Party Offerings. Crunch will not be liable to Customer or any third party in the event that changes in Third Party Offerings cause the unavailability of the Subscription Services or any feature or function thereof.\n2.6 Accuracy of Customer’s Contact Information; Email Notices. Customer agrees to provide accurate, current and complete information as necessary for Crunch to communicate with Customer from time to time regarding the Subscription Services, issue invoices or accept payment, or contact Customer for other purposes related to this Agreement. Customer agrees to keep any online account information current and inform Crunch of any changes in Customer’s legal business name, address, email address and phone number. Customer agrees to accept emails from Crunch at the e-mail address specified by its Users for login purposes. In addition, Customer agrees that Crunch may rely and act on all information and instructions provided to Crunch by Users from the above-specified e-mail address. Crunch may, in its discretion, share Customer contact information with third party service providers for the purposes of providing information about maintenance schedules, or Subscription Service releases or configurations. If Customer chooses to opt-out of such messages, or does not register to receive Support communications, Crunch shall not be responsible for any issues, errors, defects in the Subscription Services that could have been avoided by Customer acts on such messaging.\n3.

Except as otherwise set forth in the applicable Order Form, Customer agrees to pay all invoiced amounts within thirty (30) calendar days of the invoice date.\n3.3 Overdue Charges. If Crunch does not receive fees by the due date then, at Crunch’s discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.\n3.4 Suspension of Service. If any amounts owed by Customer for the Subscription Services are overdue, Crunch may, without limiting Crunch’s other rights and remedies, suspend Customer’s and its Users’ access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full.\n3.5 Payment Disputes.

This option can be selected in order to view or edit the script for that tile. Enabled mouse-hover responsiveness on Crunch graphs by highlighting the current bar, segment, or line (in early access). See the announcement for more information. Added a data exchange, which is a one-way bridge that allows a dataset owner who uses Crunch to share a view of a dataset with a receiving organization who also uses Crunch. See the help article to learn more about how to use a data exchange at Crunch. Made speed improvements when creating and editing filters. Corrected an issue that occurred when working with bar graphs in the ‘Edit’ panel: categories that were moved to the \u0026ldquo;Fixed to bottom\u0026rdquo; section were not appearing on the Colors tab, which has now been fixed. Backend/CrunchDB Removed the constraint that subvariable codes (\u0026ldquo;aliases\u0026rdquo;) must be unique across the entire dataset. Subvariable codes must still be unique within the same array, and all references to subvariables by their alias are now required to be qualified by the alias of their parent array. Improved dataset locking functionality to reduce any friction. Help desk and website improvements Created a new article that describes how to create pairwise tests with weighted data.

Previously, multitables using filter columns could sometimes show misaligned rows of results for non-enumerated variable types (text, numeric, and datetime). Crunch Automation Added the UNSUSPEND USERS command, which allows you to reactivate suspended users. Adjusted the [] syntax for subvariables: a subvariable_code is a regular identifier and cannot use [] syntax (otherwise, an error occurs). Visit this help article to view an example. Backend/CrunchDB Removed the ability to export datasets to Parquet format (through both the web app and the API) due to compatibility issues with the latest versions of Python.

Users may notice small changes to the layout. Added “Extend row labels” (default off) to the Properties tab, which makes a table use all the available horizontal space to better accommodate long labels. Crunch Automation Added the REDEFINE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM CONDITIONS command, which allows you to redefine a variable that was created using the CREATE MULTIPLE DICHOTOMY FROM CONDITIONS command. Updated the CREATE FILTER command so that it now supports a COMPLETE CASES modifier. Made the following performance improvements: Decreased the time it takes to run large scripts. System scripts that take longer to execute now show a progress bar and will no longer time out. Added additional help information about the various types of scripts you can use with Crunch Automation. Backend/CrunchDB Updated the error messaging when using the copy-from operation: if it fails to copy artifacts from one dataset to another, it now properly marks it and provides a reason why it failed.

Fixed the following: Deck exports with quotes in the file names are now sanitized instead of failing. When applying a dashboard group filter, a bivariate bar graph tile with a numeric array in the row position would fail to load if both of the following conditions were true: the tile was configured to show empty columns and applying the filter had yielded one or more empty columns.

The mean of a categorical-scale univariate analysis was incorrectly suppressed when the ‘minimum base size warn’ handling was enabled. Mean cell values that were below the minimum base size for the warn scenario were incorrectly exported as percentages. In the extended settings of the Display Controller, the checkboxes for Subtotals, Categories, and Both have been replaced by radio buttons, which better reflect the single-choice nature of these options. The \u0026ldquo;Empty rows/columns\u0026rdquo; checkbox option has been moved to the \u0026ldquo;Display\u0026rdquo; column on the left. To accompany this change, Crunch will now shift users to the \u0026ldquo;Categories and subtotals\u0026rdquo; setting if they try to load an analysis that would otherwise appear blank — because their setting is \u0026ldquo;Subtotals only\u0026rdquo; and the analysis has no subtotals.

Crunch has long offered exports of analyses and tab books to Excel files, which, in addition to their own value, enabled people to get results from Crunch to PowerPoint by copying a cell range from Excel into a slide. That’s a bit tedious, though, and we wanted to do better, which is why we are excited to announce that PowerPoint exports from Crunch are now available if you have ‘Early access’ enabled in the app. We’re eager for feedback, so please try it and let us know how we can improve it to make it truly awesome for you.\nNow you can download your Crunch decks of saved analyses directly to PowerPoint files. Each analysis shows up as a graph (or table) on a slide, and these graphs are fully customizable in PowerPoint so you can right click on them and access the underlying data. You can even apply your own style and template with just a few clicks. Here’s how:\nDownload To get a PowerPoint file, open the deck tray from the right edge of the screen and from the dropdown select the deck you want to download. At the bottom of the tray, click the download button, which instead of just downloading an Excel file as before, gives you the option of Excel or PowerPoint. When you select one, the download starts.\nCustomize in PowerPoint When you open the deck in PowerPoint, you’ll see all of the analyses from your Crunch deck as slides. These are all fully editable: the charts in the slides are just as if you had made them yourself in PowerPoint, or pasted an Excel chart into PowerPoint. Turn your bar chart into a 3D pie chart, edit the legend placement, change the colors, anything you want.\nYou can even edit the data series behind the chart. For example, you may want to take slices of multiple charts and show them on the same slide. Each chart effectively has an Excel table embedded behind it, which you can alter as you need.\nApply templates From there, you can style it using a built-in or custom theme.\nWhat’s more, because the graph is native PowerPoint, you can seamlessly incorporate your results from Crunch into your already carefully and consistently styled presentations; the graphs will take on the styles defined in your presentation. Simply drag, or copy and paste the whole slide or just the graph from the Crunch download into your deck.\nWe need your feedback! We want to make the Crunch Deck to final-product deck process even smoother, so we want to hear from you: what steps would save you time? What could we do better in these presentations?

We\u0026rsquo;re in the process of releasing some plotting methods in our crplyr R package that define methods for ggplot2\u0026rsquo;s autoplot() function. autoplot() was the ideal approach for us to encapsulate the logic of how to \u0026ldquo;just do the right thing.\u0026rdquo; You can do the analysis you want, and it will make smart choices about how to display it with no additional input\u0026ndash;all of which you can control or override with additional ggplot2 layers, if you want.\nThis lets us plot Crunch variables and high dimensional survey cross-tabs easily, while making sure that the plot always fits the data.\nlibrary(ggplot2) library(crplyr) crunch::login() ds \u0026lt;- loadDataset(\u0026#34;Not-so-simple dataset with all types\u0026#34;) ds %\u0026gt;% group_by(pasta, food_groups) %\u0026gt;% summarize(count=n()) %\u0026gt;% autoplot() ds %\u0026gt;% group_by(abolitionists, food_groups) %\u0026gt;% summarize(count=n()) %\u0026gt;% autoplot(\u0026#34;tile\u0026#34;) autoplot(ds$ec, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;) Making it look easy, though, can be hard work. Our autoplot methods inspect the input objects to understand their dimensionality and data types and choose an appropriate visualization. Figuring out and passing the right arguments to the right places can be messy, so in order to make these functions work, we took advantage of tidyeval, a framework that systematizes non-standard evaluation in R, now also supported in the new 3.0.0 release of ggplot2.\nTo illustrate this pattern, this blog post goes through a simplified example using the \u0026ldquo;diamonds\u0026rdquo; example dataset and pure dplyr methods. We\u0026rsquo;ll create a plotting function that adjusts to the number of grouping variables in a tibble. This lets you pipe data from a dplyr pipeline into a single function and get a meaningful, appropriate plot.\nThe actual code for our Crunch autoplot methods is here.\nNon-Standard Evaluation: Great Power, Great Pain A great feature the R language has is that it lets you access and manipulate the environment in which a function is called. This non-standard evaluation (NSE) gives package authors a flexible and powerful way to build programming interfaces.\nAt Crunch, we use NSE a lot. One example is in reporting better error messages. If you send the wrong data to the API, you might get back a response like 400: Payload is malformed. That\u0026rsquo;s not very helpful even for users who know our API well. We use NSE to inspect the user\u0026rsquo;s calling environment, figure out which variables or data structures are causing the problem, and suggest a fix: instead of a generic validation message, we error with the more helpful ds$some_name must be a Crunch Variable, pointing back to the input that the user typed.\nDespite working with NSE all the time, we\u0026rsquo;re pretty sure that we\u0026rsquo;ve never once gotten it right on the first try. The main reason is that whenever you are capturing an expression to evaluate later you need to also keep track of which environment you should evaluate that expression in. This makes it really difficult to pass unevaluated expressions between functions and have the evaluation occur without error. For instance, take this code which replaces a missing function argument with a logical value:\nf1 \u0026lt;- function(i, j, ...) { args \u0026lt;- eval(substitute(alist(i, j, ...))) args \u0026lt;- replace_missing(args) return(as.character(args)) } replace_missing \u0026lt;- function(args){ out \u0026lt;- lapply(args, function(x){ if (is.symbol(x)) { x \u0026lt;- tryCatch(eval(x), error = function(c){ msg \u0026lt;- conditionMessage(c) if (msg == \u0026quot;argument is missing, with no default\u0026quot;) { return(TRUE) } else { stop(c) } }) } return(eval(x)) }) return(out) } This code captures an expression at the top level, and passes it down to a second function which returns TRUE if it can\u0026rsquo;t find the argument, and evaluates expression if it can. We use code very similar to this for subsetting CrunchCube objects.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a tricky mistake here though: we aren\u0026rsquo;t specifying in which environment we want that evaluation to take place. So if we happen to send a variable that is used somewhere in the call stack, we\u0026rsquo;ll get the wrong result:\nx \u0026lt;- 1 y \u0026lt;- 1 f1(1, , 3) ## [1] \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TRUE\u0026quot; \u0026quot;3\u0026quot; f1(y, , 3) ## [1] \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TRUE\u0026quot; \u0026quot;3\u0026quot; f1(x, , 3) ## [1] \u0026quot;x\u0026quot; \u0026quot;TRUE\u0026quot; \u0026quot;3\u0026quot; What\u0026rsquo;s happening here is that when the final eval(x) is happening, x is identified through lexical scoping, and so it ends up using the x that\u0026rsquo;s in the lapply environment, rather than the one that\u0026rsquo;s in the global environment. To fix this, we need to specify the environment where that evaluation should take place. This is an easy thing to forget, and presents its own problems if you move functions around, or later call them in a different order.\nEnter the Quosure Tidyeval offers a solution to this problem: it bundles the expression and its environment in a single object called a \u0026ldquo;quosure\u0026rdquo;. What this means is that as a developer, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about matching expressions to environments and can pass unevaluated expressions between functions with confidence. Because the expression and the environment are bundled together, when you end up evaluating it you won\u0026rsquo;t ever be surprised by the result.\nAutoplot Back to our autoplot() project, our initial goal is to have a single function that will produce different plots based on the number of grouping variables in the tibble it receives. First, we create a general plotting function that figures out which plotting sub-function to use:\nlibrary(ggplot2) library(dplyr) autoplot \u0026lt;- function(df) { # Add grouping variable which was stripped by summarize df \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% group_by(!!!groups(df), !!sym(names(df)[length(groups(df)) + 1])) if (length(groups(df)) == 1) { plot_fun \u0026lt;- plot_1d } else { plot_fun \u0026lt;- plot_2d } vars \u0026lt;- syms(names(df)) plot_fun(df, vars) } The function inspects the data frame and then selects a plotting function based on the number of groups in it. It then captures the names of the dataset as a list of symbols and passes it down to the plotting function. The next step is to write the two plotting functions that actually do the work:\nplot_1d \u0026lt;- function(df, vars){ groups \u0026lt;- vars[vars %in% groups(df)] measure \u0026lt;- vars[length(vars)][[1]] df %\u0026gt;% select(!!groups[[1]], !!measure) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(!!measure)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = !!measure, y = !!groups[[1]])) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() } diamonds %\u0026gt;% group_by(cut) %\u0026gt;% tally() %\u0026gt;% autoplot() The convenient thing about using tidy eval in this case is that we can confidently pass the unevaluated names into both the dplyr and ggplot2 code without worrying that the evaluation will fail. This means we can arrange the dataset based on the measure name, and then plot that measure even though we don\u0026rsquo;t know ahead of time what the measure will be called. We can do the same thing with the 2d plot:\nplot_2d \u0026lt;- function(df, vars){ groups \u0026lt;- vars[vars %in% groups(df)] measure \u0026lt;- vars[length(vars)][[1]] df %\u0026gt;% select(!!!groups, !!measure) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(!!measure)) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x = !!measure, y = !!groups[[1]], , color = !!groups[[2]])) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() } diamonds %\u0026gt;% group_by(cut ,clarity) %\u0026gt;% tally() %\u0026gt;% autoplot() This is basically the same code as the 1D plot except that we used the splice operator (!!!) in the select call and added another grouping variable on the color dimension.\nWhat happens when you have more than three dimensions? The ggplot2 package allows us to use tidyeval to dynamically add facets.\nautoplot \u0026lt;- function(df) { # Add grouping variable which was stripped by summarize df \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% group_by(!!!groups(df), !!sym(names(df)[length(groups(df)) + 1])) groups \u0026lt;- groups(df) if (length(groups) == 1) { plot_fun \u0026lt;- plot_1d } else { plot_fun \u0026lt;- plot_2d } vars \u0026lt;- syms(names(df)) out \u0026lt;- plot_fun(df, vars) if (length(groups) \u0026gt; 2) { groups \u0026lt;- syms(groups) out \u0026lt;- out + facet_wrap(vars(!!!groups[3:length(groups)])) } return(out) } diamonds %\u0026gt;% group_by(cut, color, clarity) %\u0026gt;% summarize(number_of_diamonds = n()) %\u0026gt;% autoplot() Conclusion Tidyeval solves the main challenges of working with R\u0026rsquo;s non-standard evaluation by bundling expressions and environments into quosures. The new release of ggplot2 unlocks the power of using tidyeval for making powerful visualizations quickly. Though we could have made autoplot methods for Crunch objects before tidyeval support, it would have been much more complicated and error-prone. Using tidyeval and ggplot2 3.0.0 to pass quosures between functions unlocks powerful new mechanisms of building user-friendly functions. And that let\u0026rsquo;s us do what we strive to do most: get out of the way and let our users explore their data quickly in a way that matches their intuitions for how R and tidy conventions work.\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/dev/blog/autoplot-with-tidyeval/","tags":["R","data visualization","ggplot2","tidyeval","crplyr"],"title":"Making Graphs Look Easy with ggplot2 and Tidy Evaluation"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We have developed, and are always adding to, our R (RCrunch) and Python(PyCrunch) libraries, which perform many advanced uploading, cleaning, and analytics functions.

A common task in the market-research world is to take data that is essentially a scale\u0026mdash;rate from 1 to 10, or an ordinal range of responses from \u0026ldquo;Strongly agree\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Strongly disagree\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;and collapse it into a smaller number of bins. For example, if you asked people to rate their preference on a scale of 1-10 you might want to see how the people who provide a rating between 1 and 5 compare to those who rated it between 6 and 10. This goes by a number of names like Top Box, Top Two Box, or Nets.\nCrunch has long had the ability to create a new variable by combining the categories of an existing variable. Sometimes, though, you want to see the subtotals alongside the original categories.\nOur new \u0026ldquo;headings and subtotals\u0026rdquo; feature allows you to do just that. The example above shows how subtotals look in the web app, using an example variable card from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey that we have used previously. Here, we have a question which asks respondents to rate the importance of diversity on a five point scale.\nPerhaps for our purposes, we think the five point scale is too granular, and instead we just want to get a feeling for those who generally agree compared to those who generally disagree. That grouping may make it easier for us to report conclusions from the data, or make it easier for others to interpret. We could make a new variable that collapses \u0026ldquo;Strongly disagree\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Disagree\u0026rdquo; responses into one category and \u0026ldquo;Somewhat agree\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Agree\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Strongly agree\u0026rdquo; into another. But what if we want it both ways: we want to see the higher level, aggregated values and the breakdown of percentages within each group? Maybe there are within-group differences of interest\u0026mdash;say, most of those who agree agree strongly, while those who disagree only do so \u0026ldquo;somewhat\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;that we don\u0026rsquo;t want to obscure completely.\nSubtotals can help. To make them appear in Crunch, we add some properties to the variable so that every time it is loaded, whether in the card view, the crosstabbing view, or any reports, the subtotals are shown. To define the subtotals for a variable in the web app, click on the variable\u0026rsquo;s properties, and then select Headings and Subtotals. Once there, you\u0026rsquo;re just a few clicks, drags, and drops away from fancy new subtotals.\nIf you want to script, it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to create subtotals and headings programmatically in R.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve already heard from some enthusiastic users that headings and subtotals are helping ease their workflows, and their clients are excited to see grouped subtotals right on variable cards in the app. Have a favorite aggregation you want to see added to Crunch? Have an interesting use-case or workflow using headings and subtotals? Let us know!\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/dev/features/subtotals/","tags":["analysis","nets","subtotals"],"title":"Subtotals for Categorical Data"},{"categories":["feature"],"contents":"Crunch is designed to make data accessible to many different audiences that have varying needs, expectations, and technical abilities. Our browse and analyze views allow data owners and analysts to quickly explore and analyze interesting insights in potentially large, complex datasets. However, not everyone has time to explore a dataset\u0026mdash;some need to see key findings at a glance.\nTo meet this executive-type need, we\u0026rsquo;re introducing a new dashboard feature.\nThis dashboard provides a quick view of up to four analyses, right when you open a dataset. These views are dynamic: when new data is added to the dataset, the dashboard updates with the latest values.\nIn keeping with Crunch\u0026rsquo;s philosophy that exploring data should be instant and intuitive, the graphs and tables on a dashboard can be a starting point for further analysis if you want to dig deeper. Double-click on an analysis to open it in the full-screen view, where you can explore by adding filters, changing variables, or customizing the analysis using the display controller.\nAt any time when working with a dataset, you can return to the dashboard by clicking its icon at the top of the screen.\nCreating a Dashboard If you are a dataset editor, setting up a dashboard for your dataset takes just a few steps. First, save the analyses you want to appear in the dashboard to a deck. Then, indicate that you want to use that deck as the source for your dashboard by clicking the dataset name, selecting Configure Dashboard, and select the deck. See Configuring a Dataset Dashboard for more information. To change the composition of the analyses that show in the dashboard, edit the saved slides in your deck, and the changes will be reflected in the dashboard.\nThe Future of Dashboards There are lots of enhancements we plan to add to the dashboards, and your feedback about how you\u0026rsquo;d like to see them improved is greatly appreciated. Let us know what you think at support@crunch.io.\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/dev/features/dataset-dashboard/","tags":["dashboards","clients","graphs"],"title":"Introducing Dashboards"},{"categories":["general"],"contents":"At Crunch we greatly value tests. We have unit tests, functional tests, and the stack wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be complete without end-to-end tests. Good tests allow us to update code quickly and confidently.\nFor our end-to-end testing we use Nightwatch.js, a JavaScript testing tool that uses Selenium to drive a browser to perform tests. Our goal is to be able to test our Python backend, our REST APIs, and the behavior of our JavaScript single-page application, using a real browser, running real code.\nAnyone that has set up Selenium knows that it can be very picky about the versions of the different tools you should have. Selenium 3.4.0 might need ChromeDriver 2.31 which requires Chrome 56.3920.234034249324234329 (okay, so those version numbers may be made up), and unless you have the exact same versions every single time, it can easily result in tests that work on one developer\u0026rsquo;s machine but not on another.\nCompounding the version mismatch problem, we build and test our entire stack on a Jenkins cluster. Many of our developers would code and test on Apple MacOS, but our Jenkins pipeline was running on Ubuntu or CentOS. This led to messages like these being posted to our Slack channel:\nnew variable tests pass locally so I\u0026rsquo;m sending them to jenkins for failure\nand\nonce again it passes locally (I’m tired of saying that). we’ll see if it passes the Jenkins Arbitron 5000\nAs a result, developers were less likely to run all tests locally before pushing because Jenkins was the final arbiter of truth, and well, it would pass locally anyway (right?). Moreover, trying to debug this kind of \u0026ldquo;works on my machine\u0026rdquo; problem was really, really painful.\nIn addition to the cost to developers, operations spent an awful lot of time testing Selenium/ChromeDriver/Chrome versions to verify that everything continued to work. Linux package management makes installing the latest version of a package incredibly simple, but rolling back is less so. Unless you manually keep around the old versions of packages, you end up scouring the net for just the right .deb or .rpm that would make everything function again. In the mean time, developers are unhappy because you\u0026rsquo;ve just taken down their testing platform.\nThis is where Docker containers presented a perfect solution for us. Selenium makes Docker containers available in a variety of configurations on the Selenium Dockerhub. Using the standalone-chrome container, we can easily spawn a Selenium server that allows us to connect and spawn Chrome browsers for testing. The docker container is easy to start up, easy to tear down, and because it is self contained and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require installation of packages or software, easy to upgrade.\nHence the birth of nightwatchrun, which we have just made public under the MIT license. Given our existing test suite of Nightwatch tests, we wanted to be able to quickly spin up a new container, run our tests, and after the tests were completed, tear down the container. This approach solved our two big problems. Because Jenkins is running the exact same software/container as developers, \u0026ldquo;Passes locally, but not on Jenkins\u0026rdquo; is a thing of the past. Our developers can now easily run their Nightwatch tests against the exact same software stack used by Jenkins with Docker for Mac. Moreover, operations is no longer in the business of testing all kinds of different versions against each other to find the right combination of dependencies.\nnightwatchrun.sh is a simple shell script that, given a Nightwatch.js configuration file, will run a Docker container, get its IP address/port number, set some environment variables, and start Nightwatch. The environment variables are used to set the Selenium host/port number.\nYou can try it out yourself:\ngit clone git@github.com:Crunch-io/nightwatchrun.git yarn install ./nightwatchrun.sh -c nightwatch.conf.js This will output something similar to:\nRiley:nightwatchrun laurenipsum$ ./nightwatchrun.sh -c nightwatch.conf.js Starting selenium testing against environment: stable with version latest Using config file: nightwatch.conf.js Unable to find image 'selenium/standalone-chrome:latest' locally latest: Pulling from selenium/standalone-chrome 9fb6c798fa41: Pull complete 3b61febd4aef: Pull complete 9d99b9777eb0: Pull complete d010c8cf75d7: Pull complete 7fac07fb303e: Pull complete 64b080cf80c2: Pull complete 4eb86df147d6: Pull complete 4dd0b38ce61c: Pull complete 2b0fc7beb522: Pull complete 8682d4afe8ba: Pull complete 8ad935df4db2: Pull complete e3890abf9672: Pull complete 96df5dc43939: Pull complete 18b664097abd: Pull complete 984e25c49459: Pull complete 4369356a8c66: Pull complete bb31d692f888: Pull complete c11c4dfb44fe: Pull complete Digest: sha256:35f9029adb074c6a23c367e0c4a5986bd7fa0fb14cdac7f8cdcc42a4613de392 Status: Downloaded newer image for selenium/standalone-chrome:latest 513369b2e07b93794b8ddd5837131475c58405e7ea6d60fcf8447edec7c1c227 Today's test are run against: Google Chrome 61.0.3163.100 unknown Selenium is running at 0.0.0.0 port 32785 Selenium is not yet alive.

We natively support data types that are common in survey research, and it is also simple to do things like generate population weights and apply them automatically to all calculations. And the kinds of analyses and reports that are standard among researchers are easily selected and exported.\nThese features are great if you work at a research company, or in a marketing department, or otherwise work with surveys professionally. But if you\u0026rsquo;re a software engineer, you live in code, not crosstabs and spreadsheets. So on the development team, we face this tension continually: we\u0026rsquo;re building a product for which the target audience is not people like us. How can we best allow our team to find solutions and engage our brains fully to make the product better without letting the inmates run the asylum?\nIce cream eating ice cream\nWe routinely do many things to open ourselves to our users, from discussions and screensharing with those who report bugs or request features to periodic full product demos to the team. Those are all good ways to learn more about our users and how they think, and they definitely help increase our empathy. However, there\u0026rsquo;s no better way to increase empathy with your users than to become one yourself: to eat your own ice cream (also known as eating your own dog food, although ice cream appears to be more popular amongst our team). Under normal circumstances, though, our development team doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a real reason to use our product\u0026mdash;it\u0026rsquo;s not designed to help us write software.\nAt our all-hands meetup this summer near Tahoe, we gave the team a special assignment: Import, clean, and analyze the Stack Overflow developer survey. Find something about software developers that you think our CEO should know, and deliver results to him, all using our product. It\u0026rsquo;s a great exercise because the dataset is about things developers are more likely to care about\u0026mdash;themselves and developers like them\u0026mdash;and it received a bit of popular attention and reaction. At the same time, it\u0026rsquo;s a survey\u0026mdash;so our product should be ideal for exploring it.\nResults The experience was great. Over the coming weeks, we\u0026rsquo;ll be writing more about some of the work that various people on the team did and what we found in the data. One of the fun things about the exercise was seeing how different people took the open-ended prompt and ran with it in very different directions, exploiting a broad spectrum of features of the Crunch platform.\nWe collectively created 15 different reports that covered topics from gender representation in tech to job satisfaction internationally. These reports took many different forms: there were slide decks shared with the team in the web app, Excel workbooks exported, iPython notebooks, and data visualizations done in R. Some also created a CrunchBox, our public widget that allows our users to embed data visualizations in online articles or blog posts (like this!). Here\u0026rsquo;s an example: click on the graph below to pick different variables to analyze and change the visualization settings.\nWhat does our ice cream taste like? Overall, we felt that our ice cream tasted pretty good! Yet, as with any fine dining experience, the difference between a good meal and an excellent meal comes down to the details in the service and presentation. We noticed a lot of little bugs and usability issues, rough edges that our everyday users know how to navigate but that stick out to someone new, or perhaps details that aren\u0026rsquo;t quite right but that aren\u0026rsquo;t critical enough that people bother to report them. But with our attention on them, and with our inherent drive to build a better product, we not only saw them but said, \u0026ldquo;Hey, let me just fix that right now.\u0026rdquo; We fixed about 20 issues in the web app and pushed a bunch of enhancements to our R and Python libraries as well.\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/dev/blog/devs-as-users/","tags":[],"title":"Developers As Users"},{"categories":["feature"],"contents":"We\u0026rsquo;ve just released version 1.18.0 of the Crunch R package. Current package users should see a message when they load the package instructing you how to update to the latest version. New users (or anyone) can install this latest release from CRAN with\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;crunch\u0026quot;) See the package website for further instructions.\nSince the last CRAN release in June (1.17.0), some significant features have been added. A full list of changes can be found here, but here is an overview of the main additions.\nMapping Crunch-hosted geographic data can now be set and updated. Use geo() on a variable to see if there is already associated geographic data. Use the addGeoMetadata() function to match a text or categorical variable with available geodata based on the contents of the variable and metadata associated with Crunch-hosted geographic data. This function looks at the contents of the variable and the currently available geodata files that are available on Crunch. In most cases, you can set the geographic connection with just\ngeo(ds$state) \u0026lt;- addGeoMetadata(ds$state) Once a variable has been associated with geographic data, you can use the Crunch web app to make beautiful choropleths like this:\nWe\u0026rsquo;re also working on a new R package for working with Crunch\u0026rsquo;s geographic data, so watch this space for news about that.\nNew variable builders This release adds support for case variables, what the \u0026ldquo;Build Categorical Variable\u0026rdquo; interface allows you to do in the web application. makeCaseVariable() takes a sequence of case statements to derive a new variable based on the values from other variables.\nCase variables are useful when you want a categorical variable that is dependent on the contents of other variables. For example, we had two 10 point scores for how likely a respondent was to recommend ACME corp, both unaided and aided, but what we want is an overall net promoter score for ACME corp across both aided and unaided recommendations. We could create this NPS variable simply with a case variable as follows:\nds_pets$ACME_NPS \u0026lt;- makeCaseVariable( Promoter = ds_pets$ACME_unaided \u0026gt;= 9 | ds_pets$ACME_aided \u0026gt;= 9, Neutral = ds_pets$ACME_unaided \u0026gt;= 7 | ds_pets$ACME_aided \u0026gt;= 7, Detractor = ds_pets$ACME_unaided \u0026lt;= 6 | ds_pets$ACME_aided \u0026lt;= 6, name = \u0026#34;ACME Net Promoter\u0026#34; ) Case variables match the first case that evaluates to TRUE, so in this example, a value of 9 gets classified as \u0026ldquo;promoter\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;neutral\u0026rdquo;. If none of the cases match and there is no else case specified, the system default No Data category will be used.\nmakeCaseVariable() is incredibly powerful for making complicated derived variables that are based on anything that can be expressed with a Crunch expression. Best of all, makeCaseVariable() uses the power of Crunch\u0026rsquo;s servers to do all of this computation, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to pull data and then send it back to Crunch. And, whenever the data in the input variables are changed or new rows are added, your derived variable automatically updates.\nWe also added a convenience function to create interactions of variables. interactVariables() takes two or more categorical variables and derives a new variable with the combination of each, like how the base R interact() function works, except the resulting variable is a derivation that lives on the Crunch servers, as with makeCaseVariable().\nDerived variable tools We\u0026rsquo;ve added some methods to help you work with derived variables more generally. First, you can check if a variable is derived with is.derived(ds$variable). If it is derived, you can see its derivation expression with derivation(ds$derived_variable). You can change that derivation expression by assigning a new one: derivation(ds$derived_variable) \u0026lt;- ds$var1 + ds$var2. Finally, if you want to sever the link to the variable\u0026rsquo;s sources, you can \u0026ldquo;integrate\u0026rdquo; (integration is the opposite of derivation, right?) the variable by assigning a NULL derivation, like derivation(ds$derived_variable) \u0026lt;- NULL or you can set is.derived(ds$derived_variable) \u0026lt;- FALSE. The resulting variable will no longer update when its (former) source variables are altered.\nSee derivations for more detailed documentation and information.\nMultitables Similar to the new tools for working with derived variables, there are also new methods for working with \u0026ldquo;multitables\u0026rdquo;, the table header definitions composed of multiple variables that can be used interactively in the web app and to generate tab books of the dataset. Multitables can now be updated with multitables(ds)[[\u0026quot;Multitable name\u0026quot;]] \u0026lt;- ~ var1 + var2 formula syntax. In addition, multitables can be deleted with multitables(ds)[[\u0026quot;Multitable name\u0026quot;]] \u0026lt;- NULL. Multitables also have new name() and delete() methods.\nAssorted enhancements and fixes There are many more changes in the release; see the full release notes for more details. A few other new functions are worth mentioning.\nBetter integration with the web application. You can copy the URL from the browser in the web app and pass it to loadDataset() to load the same dataset in your R session. To go the other way, call webApp() on your R dataset object and it will open it in your web browser. resetPassword() allows you to trigger a password reset from R. copyOrder() to copy the ordering of variables from one dataset to another. searchDatasets() provides a basic interface to the Crunch search API for finding variables and datasets. Support for streaming data: check for received data with pendingStream(); append that pending stream data to the dataset with appendStream(). New website Finally, you may have noticed that all of the links here point to a new website for the crunch package, built with the pkgdown static site generator. We\u0026rsquo;re excited to have a new space to develop with improved, easier-to-use documentation and examples. Check back there for the latest updates to the package, and see the Crunch + R page for more developments.\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/dev/features/r-package-1-18-0/","tags":["R","release","geo"],"title":"Crunch R Package 1.18.0 Released"},{"categories":["feature"],"contents":"A wealth of information can be locked in text data.

In a system designed to house and share large volumes of data, the ability to quickly find the data that\u0026rsquo;s important right now is critical. We\u0026rsquo;re continually working to improve how data is indexed to make searching faster and more accurate, and we just added a couple new ways for you to refine your searches to get to what you are looking for faster and more easily.\nSearch Filters Two dropdown menus at the top of the panel help you to dial in your search.\nOn the left, the Type filter lets you specify Datasets, Variables, or Categories to limit your search to that type of object. For example, imagine you had a dataset titled \u0026ldquo;Changing attitudes towards Gender Identity\u0026rdquo;; you might try searching for it using the term Gender, only to find that you get dozens of results from every dataset with a \u0026ldquo;Gender\u0026rdquo; variable. By limiting the search to Datasets, you can quickly find what you are looking for.\nOn the right, the Date filter lets you limit your search to recent datasets.\nWe use the End Date property of the dataset to determine the date of a dataset. This property can be viewed in Dataset Properties, and is typically set by the data owner when the dataset is imported.\nSearch in a Project Previously, if you searched from within a dataset, your search would be limited to that dataset by default, and if you searched outside a dataset, you would search all datasets. We found that for users with many datasets distributed over multiple projects, the ability to search within a project allowed them to better find what they were looking for, so we\u0026rsquo;ve made the default search from outside a dataset be limited to that project.\nA Search all datasets link below the search result allows you to broaden the scope of your search, and you\u0026rsquo;ll find that when searching within a dataset, the Search project option has been added.\nIn addition, the context for your search now appears at the top of the search panel (e.g. in the example, the HipBrand project is being searched).\nWe hope these search refinements will help you find what you are looking for a more efficiently.

Now, you can click the dataset or project name for actions related to it, while user settings and signing out are accessed by clicking the 3 vertical dots in the upper right.\nNew graphs: Better looking, better titling, better tooltips We are very excited to be rolling out a complete refresh to all of our graphs – bar plots, histograms, time plots, dot plots – the whole nine yards. In addition to an improved visual style, these graphs more gracefully handle long variable and category names, and they include more informative tooltips, allowing you to dig into the data by hovering your cursor over the parts that interest you. Let’s take a look at a few of the new visualizations.\nBar plots Our bar plots now benefit from clearer labeling and improved interactivity. Hovering on a bar gives you the category label and the value.\nIn addition, you will now notice a third option available in the display controller (in addition to table and graph), when viewing a 2-way analysis – a stacked bar plot.\nStacked Bars When viewing a 2-way analysis, the display controller now offers two options for graphs – a grouped bar chart (seen above), as well as stacked bars. Stacked bars offer another way to see the data and make comparisons, and they offer greater information density, allowing you to make comparisons across more groups.\nYou can toggle the base used for the stacked bars (i.e. whether the second variable is shown relative to the first variable or relative to the base as a whole), using the percentage-direction control. Time plots While time plots are not new to Crunch, we’ve made some major improvements. In addition to increased legibility, you can now click categories in the axis to hide them from the graph, or double-click one to show only that category. Hovering on the graph lets you see the value at any point along the line, allowing you to see broad trends or to zero in on individual values.\nProxima Nova: New look, new typeface Eagle-eyed Crunch users may have noticed that our type face has changed. After much consideration, we’ve decided to switch from Avenir to Proxima Nova. We find Proxima Nova to be more legible through a wider range of sizes, giving us more options in our design of tables, graphs, and the interface as a whole.\nMore to come We have more improvements and additions to our visualizations planned for the coming months.

Here’s how it works.\nCreating a Draft Open dataset properties of a dataset you are currently editing; you’ll see the Draft button on the right side of the screen.\nClick Create Draft to create and open a draft of the current dataset. Now you can append new rows of data, reorganize variables, create new variables, and edit dataset and variable metadata freely, and your clients won’t see your changes until you are ready. The draft dataset is automatically made available to others who have edit permissions on the current dataset, so multiple editors can make changes collaboratively or allow other stakeholders to review and sign off on changes. Other editors will see the draft marked with the draft label.\nWhile a draft exists, we prevent the original and draft datasets from getting out of sync by warning anyone who attempts to edit the original and pointing them to the draft. Additionally, if you find that you are not happy with the changes you’ve made, you can simply delete the draft dataset and start over again by creating a new draft.\nPublishing Once you are satisfied with the draft, your changes can be published by returning to dataset properties in the draft and clicking Publish. The original dataset will be updated with the changes from the draft and the draft will be deleted.\nWe are confident this feature will make managing data for your clients a better experience for you and for them.

If something requires a human to remember to do an extra manual step, it won\u0026rsquo;t happen consistently. We automate test running so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to fix the same bug twice. We write code to do tedious tasks so that we can devote our mental energy to harder problems. We automate processes and policies so that developers don\u0026rsquo;t have remember the right things to do—the build and continuous-integration systems guide us.\nOccasionally we find an area where we are doing manual, menial tasks, and someone will carve out some time to automate them away. Recently we noticed that our API documentation wasn\u0026rsquo;t consistently being updated. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that developers were failing to write documentation updates with each change—that part is integrated with our build and review process. Rather, the updates were to markdown files, but the static site generator that turned them into HTML wasn\u0026rsquo;t being run regularly.\nGitHub builds Jekyll sites automatically, and we use it for some other pages. But this one, while in Ruby, required an extra build step. And we don\u0026rsquo;t use Ruby in production and don\u0026rsquo;t have any Ruby developers on the team, so there was a nontrivial setup cost associated with being able to build the docs website. Some of us (on OSX/macOS) struggled to get a working Ruby setup. So no one really wanted to mess with it.\nPlus, someone had to remember to take action when there were changes to the documentation markdown. Even the best multitaskers among us struggled to keep track consistently. As a result, the published documentation was often only updated when someone asked us about an API that we knew was documented but didn\u0026rsquo;t show up in our api reference.\nThat situation was not improving on its own, and as we were starting to add another static site (this blog), also using GitHub Pages and also not using Jekyll—it uses Hugo—we figured it was time to learn how to automate away this build step.\nAutomating the site build Our goal: automatically build the site and deploy on GitHub Pages using Travis-CI. On each push to the master branch, build it, commit the built code to the gh-pages branch, and push that. GitHub Pages then updates what it is serving.\nThere are lots of blog posts about how to use Travis to build your static site. Many of them were helpful. Some gave bad advice. None were complete enough to just drop in and use. In the end, it took nine attempts to get the build-and-publish working for the API docs and ten attempts for the dev blog. The following discussion synthesizes the useful parts of those posts and adds (or emphasizes differently) the parts that we found essential. The discussion does assume familiarity with GitHub, Travis-CI, and static-site generators, so if you need more context on those, start with those other blog posts (or Google).\n1. Make a GitHub API key and encrypt it Your build script needs more access to the repository on GitHub than Travis typically does—it needs to be able to push. To allow this, generate an API key for this job, encrypt it, and add it to the .travis.yml.\nFirst, go to the GitHub site and generate a new token. You only need to give it access to the public_repo scope because your GitHub Pages repository needs to be public anyway.\nOnce you have that, encrypt it using travis\u0026rsquo;s Ruby library (yes, you still need a functioning Ruby environment, but only this once). See their instructions. Note that you\u0026rsquo;re not just encrypting the API token, you\u0026rsquo;re encrypting the pair of NAME=tokenstring, so remember that variable name for use in your script. To keep with the examples here (and borrowing from somewhere else on the internet), we did:\ngem install travis travis encrypt GH_TOKEN=token --add where token is the string copied from the GitHub page when the token was generated. Do this in the directory of your git repository, and the --add it will add it to the .travis.yml file for you.\n2. Create an orphan gh-pages branch In order to set \u0026ldquo;gh-pages\u0026rdquo; as the branch from which to serve the website, the branch needs to exist. And you don\u0026rsquo;t want or need it to have any of your markdown and theme code—you just want it to have the generated site. So, create an empty \u0026ldquo;orphan\u0026rdquo; branch called \u0026ldquo;gh-pages\u0026rdquo; and push that. This post has a simple explanation; here is some sample code that\u0026rsquo;s four lines too long.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve pushed, you can turn on GitHub Pages. Now you\u0026rsquo;re ready to start composing the .travis.yml file that will drive the build.\n3. Re-clone the repository Travis will as a matter of course clone your github repository and checkout the current branch. Unfortunately, for efficiency, it only clones the active commit—there\u0026rsquo;s no branch history, and importantly, no other branches. You need to be able to build on master, then checkout gh-pages and commit the build artifacts there. In order to do this, clone the repository again and get the full tree. So this goes in one of the sections that runs code:\n- git clone https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/$TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG.git $TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG 4. Run only on the master branch We don\u0026rsquo;t want any development branches to be built and pushed to our production site automatically. And moreover, if the Travis workflow is build, commit, and push to gh-pages, each build would kick off another build if we didn\u0026rsquo;t restrict it. So this goes in the .travis.yml:\nbranches: only: - master 5. Add some git config The commit will fail if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a username. You could inline it with the commit, but it reads more cleanly if you set them up before.\n- git config user.email \u0026quot;you@example.com\u0026quot; - git config user.name \u0026quot;You\u0026quot; 6. On commit, pass if there are no changes If there are no changes, git commit will exit with an error code, which will terminate your script and mark your build as failed. Normally, there will be changes to commit, but sometimes, like when you\u0026rsquo;re tweaking your .travis.yml to get the build to work, there won\u0026rsquo;t be. However, if you add || true to the end of the line, the script will continue to evaluate. So we added that to the git commit and git push lines.\n7. Push quietly A few blog posts recommended adding the --quiet flag to the git push command, and/or to redirect the standard output to /dev/null, because otherwise it would print your GitHub token, thus defeating the purpose of encrypting it in step 1. Eventually someone realized that this was a security vulnerability by which tokens could be harvested from Travis logs. Consequently, Travis has presumably fixed this so that push doesn\u0026rsquo;t print your token anymore, so it\u0026rsquo;s likely fine to omit this detail now, but we\u0026rsquo;ve left the \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 in there anyway—it\u0026rsquo;s not hurting anything, and we weren\u0026rsquo;t looking at the push log anyway once we got the flow working.\nWalking through the build scripts Here are the end results. For the API docs, we use a Ruby container, install the bundler package, do a fresh clone of the repository so we get all the branches, and then install necessary dependencies. In the build script called next, the HTML and other static files are generated. Then we checkout the gh-pages branch, delete the old static files, and copy in the ones we just built. After that, commit, push, and the site is updated.\nFor the dev blog, the flow is a little different: we use Hugo (golang) instead of a Ruby library, and instead of pushing to gh-pages, we copy the built blog to serve as a subdirectory of our company website, which is hosted in a different repository. (We do also publish a version to gh-pages, a holdover from our initial testing process, so that\u0026rsquo;s woven in the script too, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a necessary part.)\nThere are a few Hugo-specific features in the dev blog build as well. First, the \u0026ldquo;theme\u0026rdquo; is not part of our repository, so we need to install it by cloning it from GitHub as well. (Note that this means that you should be sure to add the \u0026ldquo;themes\u0026rdquo; directory to your .gitignore file, as well as the \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; directory to which the built site gets generated.) Second, as this blog notes at the very bottom, by some quirk feature of how Travis builds go projects, the Hugo build will fail unless you provide a Makefile, which can be empty. So, touch Makefile and commit before you throw the job up on Travis.\nFinal observations Script or YAML? Some blogs proposed putting your build script into a .sh file that the .travis.yml file invokes. We didn\u0026rsquo;t find that to help anything. Unless you\u0026rsquo;re planning to run your build script outside of Travis too, there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a reason to put your build steps outside of the YAML file itself. In fact, it just complicated things—one more file to look at to debug, not to mention that you had to deal with making the shell script executable. Either way works—one of our repos uses a script, the other is all in YAML—but all in the .travis.yml seemed simpler. It evaluates like a script.\nbefore_script, install, after_success, \u0026hellip; Travis\u0026rsquo;s YAML file supports various blocks that get evaluated sequentially. Where should the code go?\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. Travis-CI is designed for running automated tests. In that context, it makes sense that you have different contexts for setup, running the tests, and things that you\u0026rsquo;d only do if the tests passed, and so on. Here, we\u0026rsquo;re just running a script. Organize your script in a way that makes sense to you, but you could put everything in install, or script, or whatever, and it should run just the same.\nJust automate it. Even if it takes you nine tries to get the Travis build set up correctly, that\u0026rsquo;s time well spent. Automation isn\u0026rsquo;t just about saving time: it\u0026rsquo;s about saving mental energy, and about making sure that important things happen without having to remember to do them. After setting up these jobs on Travis, we can much more easily push updates to our static sites and don\u0026rsquo;t have to remember to do an extra build step. That frees us to build more cool stuff!\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/dev/blog/building-the-blog-on-travis/","tags":["automation"],"title":"Using Travis-CI to Build Static Sites"},{"categories":["feature"],"contents":"We first released the tab book feature a while back, and since then, we’ve collected a number of great suggestions for how to enrich the feature. Tab books produce a static set of tables out of many variables and put results in an Excel sheet, for offline use when you don’t need interactive features like new filters or different weights. Our recent release includes several of those enhancements, most of which are new options available to you in the “export tab book” panel.\nExport all on a single page The first new option is page layout. A common request we received was to be able to export all tables in a tab book to a single sheet in the Excel workbook, rather than exporting each table to its own worksheet. While having each table in its own sheet might be more readable when you’re looking at just one, it is difficult in Excel to click through the tabs in a workbook to scan through the whole tab book. For browsing lots of results in Excel, scrolling down a single worksheet is often less tedious.\nThe default of one-table-per-sheet is unchanged, but to export a tab book with all tables stacked on a single Excel worksheet, toggle the “layout” setting in the export panel.\nInclude a table of contents A table of contents can also be useful when it comes to navigating a large tab book. If you choose to add a table of contents to your tab book, the first sheet will show a list of all tables in the tab book. You can click an item to navigate directly to it — to the relevant sheet if exporting to multiple sheets or to the appropriate place in the single large table if exporting to a single page. This provides another easy way to navigate through a large tab book.\nHypothesis testing Hypothesis testing provides a visual heuristic, highlighting values in crosstabs that are above or below the marginal, or average in the direction of comparison (opposite of the direction of percentaging). Because it takes into account the unweighted N of respondents in each cell, it can tell you whether differences are statistically significant or not. If you have hypothesis testing enabled in the app, when you export a tab book to Excel the cell shading and p-value key will appear in the Excel spreadsheet just as it does in the app.\nUnweighted counts Previously, if you requested a tab book with a weight applied to the dataset, the “N” or “base” row of counts beneath the tables were also weighted. These are now unweighted, as they are throughout the Crunch.io app. This change allows you to see how many rows or observations in the dataset are used to compute each cell in the tables.\nLet us know what you think If you haven’t downloaded a tab book recently, check them out. If you have suggestions for how we can improve them further, let us know!\n","permalink":"//crunch.io/dev/features/tab-book-improvements/","tags":["tab books","exports"],"title":"Tab Book Improvements"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Instantly search across all your projects.
